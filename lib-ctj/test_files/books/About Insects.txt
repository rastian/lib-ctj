Afterword


Plate 1 
Insects are the most numerous of all animals Over 1000000 species 
have been identified four times more than all other animals combined 
There are nearly 100000 species of insects in North America 
Insects are arthropods which are animals with distinctly divided body parts
jointed legs and a hard outer coating called an exoskeleton 
Insects have three pairs of legs and three body parts 
Dogbane Leaf Beetles discharge a foul-smelling secretion if caught


Plate 2 
An insect's body is made up of three major parts the head the thorax and the abdomen
The antennae eyes and mouthparts are located on the head
The legs and wings are attached to the thorax 
The abdomen contains the digestive and reproductive systems 
Cow Killers are antlike wasps that get their name from their painful sting



Plate 3 
Insects have hard coverings called exoskeletons 
Exo means outside The insect's muscles are attached to the inner surface of 
the exoskeleton Stag beetles get their name from their huge mandibles or jaws 
which resemble the antlers of a stag


Plate 4 
Insects grow by a process called metamorphosis Some insects such as 
the Praying Mantis develop by simple or incomplete metamorphosis 
They go through three stages of growth egg nymph and adult 
An adult female Praying Mantis lays hundreds of eggs in large masses 
covered with a protective foam that repels birds Each egg hatches into a 
nymph which resembles a small version of the adult The nymph grows larger 
through a series of size changes until it reaches adulthood




Plate 5 
Butterflies and many other insects develop by complete metamorphosis 
They go through four distinct stages of development egg larva pupa and adult 
An adult lays an egg which produces a wormlike larva The larva feeds and grows 
then transforms into a pupa which stays dormant for some period of time When 
development of the pupa is complete an adult insect emerges Monarch Butterflies 
are the only butterflies that annually migrate both north and south



Plate 6 
Insects smell feel and sometimes hear through sensory organs called 
antennae Antennae are usually located on the front of the head 
The structure of antennae varies greatly among insects 
Virginia Ctenuchid Moths have feathery antennae



Plate 7 
Most flies have mouthparts that lap up liquids 
Black Horse Fly females suck blood from large mammals after slicing the skin 
with bladelike mouthparts Males drink nectar from flowers



Plate 8 
Insects that bite and chew their food do so by moving their mandibles 
from side to side Southeastern Lubber Grasshoppers live on roadsides in field edges
and in gardens where they feed on many kinds of leafy green plants



Plate 9 
Most adult insects have two pairs of wings attached to the thorax 
Some insects have only one pair of wings and some have no wings and are unable 
to fly Dragonflies have four wings that move independently enabling them to 
fly backward as well as forward White Tails catch and eat small insects while 
in flight



Plate 10 
Some insects mimic parts of the plants on which they live 
The Giant Walkingstick looks so much like a twig that it is easily overlooked 
by predators Walkingsticks are inactive during the day but at night they move 
about feeding on foliage



Plate 11 
Powerful muscles in their hind legs enable some insects to be active 
jumpers Gladiator Katydids live in grasslands or along roadsides where they 
feed on grass



Plate 12 
Beetles that live in lakes ponds rivers and streams have paddle-shaped 
hind legs specially adapted to help them swim Small Whirligig Beetles 
often swim in circles on the surface of the ponds and streams where they 
live They are also able to dive below the surface



Plate 13 
Insects live in almost every environment except the ocean 
They have not been able to adapt to life in saltwater Silverfish are found all 
over the world in warm dark places where they eat clothing dry foods and 
starch from bookbindings



Plate 14 
Honey Bees are social insects Many of them live together in large 
nests and work together to preserve the colony A queen lays all the eggs for 
the colony The workers are females and they maintain the hive and produce 
honey The few male drones in each colony mate with the queen and then die



Plate 15 
Most moths are nocturnal or active at night Adult Luna Moths live 
for only a short time and do not feed Adult Luna Moth caterpillars eat the 
foliage of several kinds of trees including walnut sweet gum and birch 
Luna Moths are considered an endangered species because many have been 
killed by pollutants and insecticides


Plate 16 
Insects can damage valuable crops and trees Bites or stings from 
some insects can be irritating to mammals Certain insects are responsible 
for spreading disease Others infest food supplies or destroy clothing and 
wooden structures Cockroaches have an unpleasant odor and scavenge in homes 
restaurants and food factories



Plate 17 
Many insects help humans by eating other insects that destroy crops 
Ladybug larvae and adults eat aphids and other small insects Farmers and 
gardeners often purchase ladybugs and release them near crops that are harmed 
by aphids



Plate 18 
Insects are a crucial food source for many animals that are valuable 
to us They pollinate many of the plants that provide food for us 
Useful products such as honey beeswax and silk are produced by insects 
Some people are fascinated by insects and enjoy observing their unique habits
