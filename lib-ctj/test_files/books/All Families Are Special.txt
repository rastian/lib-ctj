All Families are Special

Do you know what I found out today Mrs Mack my teacher is going to be a grandma She told our class My daughter is having a baby I'll be the baby's grandmother I can hardly wait All the kids were surprised It's funny to think that teachers have families Everyone is part of a family Mrs Mack said Would you like to talk about your families Hands shot up all over the room Mrs Mack said Sarah you begin Well said Sarah there are four of us in my family There's my mom and dad and me and my little sister Rachel She's four years old We adopted her from China when she was almost a year old Mom and Dad and I flew to China over a huge ocean miles and miles and miles away to bring Rachel home On the long plane ride home Rachel walked up and down the aisle with me holding onto my hands Everybody smiled at us We loved Rachel right away Nick was waving his hand Let's see there's Mama and Papa There's Grandma and Grandpa We have a new baby Josh I have two big sisters and two little brothers Me I'm right in the middle That makes ten people in one house When my family orders pizzas we need three super ones Ten people that's one big family Mrs. Mack said Families come in all sizes don't they Who has a small family Matt raised his hand My family is only two people my dad and me My mom died when I was two years old We have lots of pictures of her I like the wedding pictures best she looks so beautiful in her long white dress There's one of Mom and me that I like too Hannah who's never shy wanted her turn I have two mommies Michelle and Annie In our family we all ride bikes take hikes and go camping Michelle and Annie both have green thumbs That means they know how to grow flowers and vegetables I'm a good gardener too Grace was next Our family has three people she said Mom Dad and me But my Dad has to travel for his work so lots of times it's just Mom and me at home I wish he had a different job When my dad is someplace far away he calls us before I go to sleep He says I miss you Some nights he tells me something funny that happened and we both laugh Then Jessica told about her family Harry lives with us my mom my brother and me Harry's just like my dad but he's not our real father My real father moved away when I was still a baby so I never knew him My brother says he remembers him a little But Harry's great He taught me how to pitch and he helps me with my math We like a lot of the same books and movies I really like Harry It was Juan's turn My family is medium size I guess There's Mom and Dad and us kids We moved into Grandma's house when she came home from the hospital Grandma is much better now but she still needs us to help her I love Grandma's old house It has a big porch and big backyard Dad lived there when he was growing up Let's see Grandma Mom Dad me and my twin sisters Jennie and Carla that makes six people in my family Next it was Salma's turn My family lives in two places she explained Grandma and Grandpa live in Pakistan Mom and Dad were born there They came to the United States when my brother was just a baby I was born here Grandpa and Grandma come to visit us every year Grandma shows me how to make Pakistani foods like Grandpa goes to watch my brother's Little League games I wish they would stay in America but they say they're too old to leave their home for good We all cry a little when they go Then we can't wait until they come next time Next it was my turn There's me my mom and dad my sister and my brother There's our dog Callie too We used to have a cat Mama Cat but she died last summer Is it okay to say a cat and dog are part of your family Mrs Mack Sure Robert Mrs Mack said Well everyone in my family misses Mama Cat even Callie I said Kevin told us I live with Grandpa Grandma and Mom just on the weekends When Mom comes she sleeps in the bottom bunk bed in my room It used to be her room when she was growing up I love it when I wake up and she's there I have lots of aunts uncles and cousins too When the whole family gets together like on Thanksgiving it's one big bunch of people The day after Thanksgiving I always go to the movies with all my cousins In my family Christopher told us my mom and dad got divorced My dad moved to an apartment but we still live in our old house with Mom My big brother and I keep most of our things in our house with Mom But we have stuff at Dad's apartment too We're usually over there a couple of days a week That's the way it is when you divorce Emily raised her hand I have two families too she said My mom and dad are divorced Then last year Dad got married again to Karen She's not my mom but she's really nice She's my stepmom Karen's kids are my stepbrother and stepsister It took a long time until we all got used to living together Now Mom is going to marry her boyfriend Tom Tom's daughter Maria visits us on weekends We have a good time together After everyone had a turn Mrs Mack said Part of living in a family is sharing happy times and sad times Can you think of some unhappy things that happen in families Lots of hands went up The kids talked about when somebody gets sick and the doctor says It's serious Or when a mom loses her job and she can't find a new one Or when a mom and dad argue all the time and they decide to get a divorce The children feel pulled back and forth between them When we talked about good things that happen in families everybody had lots to tell about sending pictures to Grandpa and Grandma to put on the refrigerator door about our family picnics sending email to cousins going to stay with relatives who live far away building a neat treehouse with a favorite uncle feeling happy when everyone gets together on holidays Mrs Mack told us When there are bad times families help each other to feel better When there are good times families enjoy them together The different people in our families all fit together like pieces in a puzzle You are a very important piece of the picture No families are the same All families are definitely special
