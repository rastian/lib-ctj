anansi and the moss covered rock

Once upon a time Anansi the Spider was walking walking walking through the
forest when something caught his eye It was a strange moss covered rock how 
interesting Anansi said Isn't this a strange moss covered rock everything 
went black down fell Anansi senseless an hour later Anansi woke up his head was 
spinning he wondered what had happened I was walking along the path when something 
caught my eye I stopped and said isn't this a strange moss covered rock down 
fell Anansi again but this time when he woke up an hour later he knew what was 
happening Aha said Anansi this is a magic rock and whenever anyone comes along 
and says the magic words isn't this a strange hmm hmm hmm down he goes this 
is a good thing to know said Anansi and I know just how to use it So Anansi went 
walking walking walking through the forest until he came to Lion's house Lion was 
sitting on his porch at his feet was a great pile of yams Anansi loved yams but he 
was too lazy to dig them up himself Anansi said to Lion Hello Lion it is very hot 
today don't you think so yes Anansi said Lion it is terribly hot I am going for a 
walk in the cool forest said Anansi would you like to come I certainly would said 
Lion So Lion and Anansi went walking walking walking through the forest after a 
while Anansi led Lion to a certain place Lion do you see what I see oh yes Anansi 
said Lion isn't this a strange moss covered rock Down fell Lion Anansi ran 
back to Lion's house and made off with Lion's yams An hour later Lion woke up his 
head was spinning Anansi was nowhere in sight and when he got home he found that 
every single one of his yams was gone Lion was very sad But Anansi was very happy 
he couldn't wait to play his trick again once more Anansi went walking walking 
walking through the forest this time he stopped at Elephant's house Elephant was 
sitting on his porch at Elephant's feet was a great pile of bananas Anansi loved 
bananas but he was too lazy to pick them himself so he said to Elephant hello 
Elephant isn't it hot today it is Elephant agreed I am going for a walk in the 
cool forest Anansi said would you like to come that sounds nice said Elephant 
thank you for inviting me Anansi So Anansi and Elephant went walking walking 
walking through the forest after a while Anansi led Elephant to a certain place 
Elephant look do you see what I see Elephant looked yes I do Anansi isn't this a 
strange moss covered rock down fell Elephant Anansi ran back to Elephant's 
house and made off with all the bananas An hour later Elephant woke up his head 
was spinning Anansi was nowhere in sight and when he got home he found that every 
single one of his bananas was gone elephant was very sad But Anansi was very happy 
He couldn't wait to play his trick again he played it on Rhinoceros and 
Hippopotamus he played it on Giraffe and Zebra he played it on every single animal 
in the forest But all this time watching from behind the leaves was Little Bush
 Deer Little Bush Deer is small and shy and very hard to see she watched Anansi
 play his wicked trick again and again on all the other animals Little Bush Deer 
decided it was time for Anansi to learn a lesson So Little Bush Deer went deep 
into the forest to where the coconut trees grow she climbed a coconut tree and 
threw down a great many coconuts she carried the coconuts home in a basket and 
set them on her porch then she sat down beside them to wait In a little while 
along came Anansi Anansi's eyes lit up when he saw Little Bush Deer's coconuts
 Anansi loved coconuts he loved to eat the tender white coconut meat and drink 
the sweet coconut milk inside but he was much too lazy to gather coconuts himself
 instead he said Hello Little Bush Deer it is so hot today Little Bush Deer 
smiled it is very hot Anansi I am going for a walk in the cool forest would you 
like to come yes I would said Little Bush Deer So Anansi and Little Bush Deer 
went walking walking walking in the cool forest after a while Anansi led Little 
Bush Deer to a certain place Little Bush Deer look over there do you see what I 
see Little Bush Deer knew all about Anansi's trick she looked no Anansi I don't 
see anything you must see it look very carefully Little Bush Deer looked no I 
still don't see anything she said Anansi began to get angry you must see it 
look over here look right where I'm pointing do you see it now no Anansi said 
Little Bush Deer Anansi stamped his legs you see it you just don't want to say 
it Say what said Little Bush Deer you know is that what I'm supposed to say yes 
said Anansi all right then I will say it to make you happy you know said Little 
Bush Deer there I said it are you satisfied no Anansi shouted you're not supposed 
to say you know what am I supposed to say you're supposed to say isn't this a 
strange moss covered rock down fell Anansi Little Bush Deer ran and got all 
the other animals together they went to Anansi's house and took back all the good 
things he had stolen from them An hour later Anansi woke up his head was spinning 
Little Bush Deer was nowhere in sight and when he got home he found his house as 
empty as it was before but if you think Anansi learned his lesson you're mistaken 
because he's still playing tricks to this very day
