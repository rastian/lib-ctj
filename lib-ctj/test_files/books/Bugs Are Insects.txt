Bugs are insects


There are many kinds of insects living all around us Ants are insects so are crickets and mosquitoes so are butterflies and bees 


Insects come in many shapes sizes and colors They don't all look alike but there's a way to tell if something is an insect Count its legs Count how many parts make up its body


Is a ladybug an insect 
All insects have external skeletons You have a hard skeleton inside with parts that move Your skeleton holds you up and helps give your body its shape but an insect has a hard skeleton on the outside with parts that move The skeleton is like a shell around its body it holds the insect up and gives its body its shape 
A ladybug has an external skeleton does that mean it's an insect


Maybe not all insects have external skeletons but not all animals with external skeletons are insects. Crabs lobsters shrimps and scorpions have external skeletons too but they are not insects


Many insects have two pairs of wings and a pair of antennae Sometimes the antennae are long like those of crickets or butterflies Sometimes they are short like those of beetles


But all insect bodies are divided into three parts head thorax and abdomen There are six legs attached to the thorax anything that has six legs and three body parts is an insect 
A ladybug has six legs and three body parts is it an insect


Now look at a spider is it an insect  
It has an external skeleton but count its legs How many does it have now count how many body parts it has 
A spider has eight legs not six its body is divided into two parts not three so it is not an insect a spider is an arachnid Scorpions and daddy longlegs are arachnids too 


Now we know that a ladybug is an insect but is it really a bug 
We sometimes call insects bugs Many people think the two words mean the same thing but they don't A bug is an insect with a mouth like a beak and a head that forms a triangle A stinkbug is a bug so is a bedbug and so is a water strider even though it doesn't have the word bug in its name 

But a ladybug's mouth doesn't look like a beak Its head isn't shaped like a triangle a ladybug isn't a bug at all it is a beetle Beetles are insects with a pair of hard wings you can't see through that hides a second pair of clear wings The hard wings make a straight line down the top of the abdomen when they are closed 


Different kinds of insects have different kinds of mouths to suck pierce bite or chew A mosquito has a mouth that can pierce your skin and draw blood a butterfly has a long curled-up mouth part for sucking nectar from flowers just like you suck juice through a straw


Different kinds of insects have different kinds of legs as well 
Crickets have long back legs for jumping 
Water boatman have wide flat legs for paddling bees have fuzzy legs that can carry pollen from flower to flower grasshoppers have legs for making music


Some insects are good builders Ants build tunnels bees build honeycombs of wax that comes from their bodies
Wasps build paper nests these insects live in large communities where each helps the others


No matter what they look like or how they live all insects have six legs and three body parts
Here are some of the creatures you might find in your backyard are they insects


Insects are all around flying through the air chewing on leaves creeping through grass Scientists think that there are many kinds of insects than there are kinds of fish or birds or any other animal in the world 
Look in your own backyard and see how many insects you can find and always remember to count their legs
