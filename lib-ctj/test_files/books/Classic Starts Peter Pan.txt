Famous Last Words
All children grow up All except one Wendy learned this when she was playing 
in the garden one day at the age of two She brought her mother a flower and 
Mrs. Darling hugged her and said Oh why can't you stay like this forever and 
ever Before that day Wendy didn't realize she wouldn't stay the same 
Wendy had two younger brothers John and Michael They were growing too
Mrs. Darling stayed home with the children while Mr. Darling went to work in 
stocks His stocks didn't always work for him however and so the family had to 
scrimp and save They still had a nanny of course because all the other families 
in the neighborhood had one and Mr. Darling cared very much about keeping up 
with the neighbors but the Darlings were poor and so their nanny was 
actually just a giant Newfoundland dog named Nana Nana was an interesting 
nanny to say the least She didn't believe in all this newfangled talk about 
germs Sometimes she would lovingly lick the children right after she licked 
her own foot Mr. Darling was ashamed of Nana and sometimes he was cold to her 
as a result He shouldn't have been She was actually quite a treasure If the 
children wandered or dillydallied on their way to school she would bump them 
with her big head to get them back on track She never once forgot John's 
soccer uniform and she usually carried an umbrella in her mouth 
instead of a bone in case of rain And it did rain quite often in England 
All in all the Darlings were a normal happy English family Until that is 
the arrival of a boy named Peter Pan Mrs. Darling had never heard of Peter 
Pan until one day when she was tidying up her children's minds 
Most good mothers do this after their children are asleep as if minds are 
drawers and children's memories are underwear and socks that need to be 
neatly folded and put away  how Mrs. Darling would wrinkle her forehead sometimes 
at the sweet things she found in her children's minds wondering where on earth 
they had picked them up These things she would lay out and lovingly smooth 
on the bed for the children to slip on first thing in the morning 
Other times however she found mean or ugly thoughts in her children's sleepy 
heads These she would shake out and quickly hide like something pushed under 
the bed Children's minds are a curious place If someone could draw a map it 
would be full of zigzag lines and squiggles Eventually however all the lines 
and squiggles would lead to Neverland
What is Neverland you ask It is the magical island in the middle of every 
child's mind It is a place children go to mainly in their imaginations 
unless of course they have an invitation and a very special guide
Every child's Neverland is slightly different Some are in color and others 
are in black and white Some have ragged coral reefs with tiny smashed-up boats 
lonely caves and tiny huts on the beach Others have hunchbacked little 
old ladies turtles laying eggs or gnomes who like to sew Others still have 
scary first days at school trying not to laugh at church pop quizzes on 
grammar that you haven't studied for money from the tooth fairy and chocolate 
pudding  There are no rules to what one's Neverland should be 
John's Neverland had a lagoon with flamingos flying over it 
while Michael who tried hard to be like his older brother had a flamingo 
with lagoons flying over it Wendy meanwhile had a pet wolf and a boat
The island doesn't appear on any map because it never stands still If you can 
find it Neverland is a very fun place to visit during the day when it's 
sunny But in the two minutes before children go to bed it becomes scary and 
full of shadows That is why night-lights were invented
Mrs. Darling didn't know anything about Neverland Or rather she did from her 
own childhood But she had long since forgotten and so was confused when she 
bumped into the island in her travels through her children's minds
There were other things that confused her too For starters there was the name 
Peter which came up again and again in bolder letters than any other word 
in all of her children's minds especially Wendy's Who is this Peter 
she asked her daughter is he a friend of yours Well Wendy admitted not 
always You know I don't like you talking to strangers Mrs. Darling said 
But he isn't a stranger Mother Don't you remember him Why I've never heard of 
him in my life Mrs. Darling insisted but as soon as she said this she knew 
it was not quite true She could not remember meeting Peter or ever 
knowing him no she was too old for that But in the back of her mind she 
recalled a story about a boy who kept children company so that 
they would not be scared She was sure that she had believed in him 
when she was Wendy's age Well anyway even if I did remember him by now 
he would be grown up just like me she said and tucked Wendy in for the night
I'm worried about this Peter person Mrs. Darling told her husband later 
that evening Don't be he said It's probably just some nonsense put into 
their heads by that no-good nanny It will all blow over wait and see 
These are what are sometimes referred to as famous last words

Chapter
Now Peter Now

Children often find even the strangest events rather commonplace 
For example they might casually mention that when they were playing in the 
woods last Wednesday they met a ghost and played tag with him on roller skates 
It was in just this way that Wendy revealed something quite upsetting to her 
mother one morning Mrs. Darling was tidying up the nursery where all of the 
young Darling children slept and discovered some leaves on the floor
She asked Wendy about them but Wendy merely replied Peter must have left those 
leaves What do you mean Mrs. Darling asked nervously He really is quite messy 
said Wendy who was a very tidy child With a sigh she explained that Peter 
often came to the nursery at night and sat at the foot of her bed playing the 
flute Sweetheart Mrs. Darling assured her the front door is locked at night 
No one can get in He comes in through the window Wendy insisted 
He can't possibly We are three stories up Why didn't you tell me this before 
her mother cried I got hungry and forgot said Wendy who was now feeling 
rather hungry again While Wendy went to look for a snack Mrs. Darling stayed 
behind still frowning about the leaves The thing that scared her most was that 
she was fairly certain they were from a tree that did not even grow in England 
She searched the room for other clues but found none
You are making a fuss out of nothing at all Mr. Darling insisted when she told 
him Now come to bed I suppose you are right Mrs. Darling said 
Only he wasn't The very next night she tucked the children in went downstairs 
to sit by the warm fire and sew and fell asleep Almost immediately she started 
to dream She dreamed that Neverland had drifted too close to the beach and 
that a strange boy had jumped into the water and was swimming toward her 
children Wendy John and Michael were on the shore happily waving him in
This might have only been a silly dream were it not for the fact that upstairs 
the window of the children's bedroom had blown open and a boy really had flown 
in and dropped onto the floor With him was a little light no bigger than a 
fist that darted around the room like a mosquito Mrs. Darling woke with a 
start She knew at once that the swimming boy was Peter Pan She ran upstairs 
threw open the door to the children's bedroom and sure enough there he was 
He was wearing clothes made of leaves the same strange kind that he had left 
behind the last time But the strangest thing about him was that although 
he must have been very old now at least as old as she he still seemed to have 
all of his baby teeth When Peter saw Mrs. Darling he bared those pearly 
little teeth at her and growled Mrs. Darling screamed and in a split second 
Nana was there She growled too and lunged at Peter He dodged her and jumped 
out the window Mrs. Darling screamed again After all she didn't want the boy 
dead She looked down but saw no broken body Looking up she saw what looked 
like a shooting star speeding away When she turned she saw that Nana had 
something in her mouth It was Peter's shadow Nana had nipped it with her 
teeth right before Peter jumped and the shadow had snapped off 
Nana wanted to hang the shadow out the window so Peter could come back and 
get it without bothering the children But Mrs. Darling thought that it would 
look like laundry drying Mr. Darling would be upset if the neighbors saw that 
instead she decided to stuff the shadow into the bottom of a drawer hidden 
away like one of her children's unpleasant thoughts That horrid dog 
Mr. Darling said when she told him the next day what had happened She can't 
go around snapping off people's shadows left and right Why we'll be sued
Poor Nana and poor Mr. Darling too He knew he was being awful and unfair but 
he couldn't help it He was frustrated and jealous about other people doing 
better in the stock market and about the children loving Nana so very much 
possibly more than him It didn't help matters that Nana had brushed up 
against him yesterday getting white hair all over his coat Go to the doghouse 
where you belong he yelled at her George Mrs. Darling whispered remember what 
I told you about that boy What if he comes back and Nana's not here to guard 
the children but Mr. Darling would not listen he was determined to show 
everyone who was the master of the house and so out Nana went
That night as Mrs. Darling was putting the children to bed and lighting 
their night-lights they heard Nana downstairs in the yard barking she is 
just protesting being chained up John said Wendy was wiser however No that is 
how Nana barks when she smells danger she said Mrs. Darling shuddered 
Outside she saw a million stars some of which seemed to her to be hovering 
around the house as if trying to get in how she wished that she and Mr. 
Darling did not have to go to a dinner party tonight Don't worry Mama 
Michael said Nothing can hurt us when our night-lights are lit isn't that 
right This was something Mrs. Darling had told the children in the past 
so she couldn't very well take it back now That's right she said soothingly 
Night-lights are the eyes a mother leaves behind at night to watch over her 
babies Besides she told herself she and Mr. Darling would be so close only a 
few houses away What could possibly happen A few minutes later Mr. and Mrs. 
Darling were outside strolling arm in arm to their dinner party But they were 
being observed from above It was the stars spying The old stars were 
glassy-eyed and bored but the little ones were curious and full of wonder and 
winks They didn't particularly care for Peter who liked to sneak up behind 
them and try to blow them out but they were generally fond of fun and Peter 
was all about fun so they decided to help him tonight The instant Mr. and 
Mrs. Darling were safely inside the neighbor's house a commotion broke out in 
the heavens A chorus of the smallest stars in the Milky Way cried out 
Now Peter Now

Chapter Acorn Kisses and Jealous Fairies

The night-lights were still burning when Mr. and Mrs. Darling left the house 
But even a night-light gets tired sometimes It is an awful lot of work as you 
might imagine trying to stay bright and shiny all the time Wendy's light went 
out first It yawned and yawns being contagious the other two lights 
promptly yawned as well Then before any of the lights could close their 
mouths all three went out from the resulting breeze The children's room 
however was still not dark A strange blinking glow came from within a water 
jug Inside was a fairy no bigger than your hand Her name was Tinker Bell and 
she was in the jug looking for Peter's shadow Peter appeared next Tink he 
called softly Is my shadow in that jug No Tink replied emerging When Tinker 
Bell spoke it sounded like bells It was a special fairy language that only 
Peter and his boys could understand Tink told Peter that she had just spotted 
his shadow in the chest of drawers Peter threw open the drawers piling the 
clothes in a heap on the floor and found his shadow Grabbing it he tried to 
slip it back on like a pair of pants but it would not fit He tried to put it 
on like a hat but it jumped off his head His shadow it seemed did not want 
him back Peter sat on the floor and started to cry His cries woke Wendy and 
she sat up in bed Excuse me she asked politely Who are you I am Peter Pan he 
said Who are you My name is Wendy Darling I live here I live second to the 
right said Peter and then straight on until morning That's a funny address 
Wendy said I don't see what's so funny about it Peter huffed embarrassed 
Well what do people write on the envelope when they send you letters Wendy 
asked No one sends me letters Peter said in a low voice Now he was not only 
embarrassed but sad too about his lack of letters When your mother gets 
letters Wendy tried weakly I don't have a mother Peter said in a normal voice 
The funny address and the lack of letters had bothered him briefly but 
mothers he felt were overrated For Wendy however a funny address no letters 
and no mother seemed incredibly sad Peter no wonder you were crying she said 
She got out of bed and ran to hug him I wasn't crying about not having a 
mother he huffed I was crying because I can't get my shadow back on Do you 
have any glue Wendy smiled How exactly like a boy You can't glue it back on 
silly It must be sewn on I will do it for you Feeling very important Wendy got 
her sewing kit Within minutes the shadow was back where it belonged even if it 
was a bit wrinkly Wendy wondered briefly whether she should have ironed it 
first Peter cried twirling in front of the mirror Look at me and my handsome 
shadow A thank-you might be nice Wendy suggested For what Peter asked
This made Wendy so mad that she got back into bed and covered her face with 
the blankets until Peter apologized I'll forgive you if you give me a kiss 
Wendy said turning her cheek to him She was of the age when she was starting 
to think about kisses Peter hesitated confused Finally he dropped an acorn 
button into her hand Realizing that Peter was not quite that age yet and not 
wanting to embarrass him Wendy politely thanked him and said that she would 
wear his kiss on a string around her neck How old are you she asked I don't 
know Peter said I ran away on the very day I was born after I heard my parents 
talking about what I would be when I grew up Why Wendy asked I didn't want to 
grow up Peter said simply Now I live with the lost boys and the fairies 
fairies Wendy breathed wide-eyed Immediately she began to ask Peter everything 
she could think to ask about fairies You see Peter explained when the very 
first baby laughed for the very first time its laugh broke into a million 
pieces Each piece then became a fairy This talk of fairies suddenly reminded 
Peter of Tinker Bell who was being awfully quiet He rose to look for her 
Wendy jumped up excited Do you mean to say there is an actual fairy in this 
room They both listened for her but all Wendy could hear was the tinkle of 
bells that's Tink That's fairy language Peter frowned and it seems to be 
coming from inside that chest of drawers Suddenly Peter laughed He realized he 
had locked Tinker Bell in the drawer She must have flown in when he reached 
for his shadow how she screamed when he let her out Tink he said watching her 
fly around the room in a fury such language What's she saying Wendy asked 
watching the angry blur I do wish she would stand still so I could see her 
Will she be my fairy Tink Peter said Stand still for a second would you Wendy 
wants to see you and for you to be her fairy Tinker Bell clinked something 
angry in reply She says you are a huge ugly girl and she can't be your fairy 
because she is my fairy Well Wendy huffed She is not very polite Peter had to 
agree Since Tinker Bell wasn't cooperating Wendy turned her attention back to 
Peter She had so many more questions for him He told her all about the lost 
boys who had fallen out of their strollers when they were babies and had never 
been claimed I'm their captain he said What fun Wendy replied but are there no 
girls on the island no Peter replied Girls are too smart to fall out of their 
strollers What a nice thing to say Wendy replied blushing Suddenly Wendy 
screamed It felt as if someone had pulled her hair That must be Tink Peter 
explained She certainly is being naughty today Tinker Bell told Peter that she 
would continue to misbehave so long as Peter kept being nice to Wendy 
just like Mr. Darling it seemed that the little fairy suffered from one 
enormous case of jealousy

Chapter  The Birds Leave the Nest Peter Wendy said why did you come to the 
nursery to hear the story your mother was telling Peter replied Wendy was a 
bit disappointed to learn that he had not come for her but she asked which 
story was it It was the story about the lady who lost her glass slipper but I 
had to leave and I missed the ending That's Cinderella Wendy said 
I can tell you how it ends The prince finds her and they live happily ever 
after Peter turned to the window Wait where are you going Wendy asked Back to 
Neverland to tell the other boys Peter replied Don't go Wendy begged I know 
lots of other stories even better than that one Well then come on he said 
dragging her We'll fly back together You can tell the stories to the lost boys 
Let go of me Wendy cried She was very flattered to be asked of course but she 
couldn't leave her poor mother Besides she couldn't fly I'll teach you Peter 
said Wendy had always wanted to learn how to fly Think how much the lost boys 
will love you Peter continued You could be a sort of mother to them You could 
even tuck them in None of them has ever been tucked in before 
This was too much for Wendy to resist She did have very strong maternal 
feelings What about John and Michael she asked If I leave them they will be 
lost boys in a way as well They can come I'll teach them to fly too At this 
the boys jumped out of bed They had been listening quietly the entire time 
not letting on that they were really awake But at the thought of flying they 
could no longer stay still Suddenly Peter spun around he said His eyes 
narrowed Listen Do you hear that Wendy didn't hear anything Exactly Peter said 
Nana sensing his presence had been barking since Peter had entered the 
nursery Now she was oddly quiet There can be only one explanation John said 
She's broken her chain and is running up here I want to learn how to fly and 
Nana's going to ruin everything Pretend to be sleeping Peter instructed 
Tink and I will hide and so it was that Liza the family cook saw the children 
resting peacefully when she entered with the very excited Nana Liza had 
finally had enough of Nana's barking and thought the best way to ease the 
dog's mind would be to bring her upstairs and show her that the children were 
fine I told you so she whispered to Nana They are all safe and sound Silly dog
Nana was still suspicious but Liza would have no more of it She dragged Nana 
downstairs and chained her up again What else could Nana do She strained and 
strained at her chain until it finally broke Then she ran over to where Mr. 
and Mrs. Darling were dining and burst into the house barking for help
Even Mr. Darling realized at once that something must be seriously wrong at 
home Thanking their hosts he and Mrs. Darling rushed out but it had been ten 
minutes since Nana had been in the nursery and Peter Pan could do a lot in ten 
minutes You simply think wonderful thoughts Peter explained and they lift you 
up in the air The children tried and tried thinking the happiest thoughts they 
could but still they could not rise from their beds Of course Peter was not 
telling them the whole truth No one can fly unless some fairy dust has been 
blown on them Tinker Bell was still being uncooperative but Peter had some 
dust on his hands from holding her earlier He blew a bit on each of the 
children and wouldn't you know it they flew how they laughed as they sailed 
clumsily around their room Watch out Michael cried as he narrowly missed 
crashing into his brother by the bathroom Let's go outside John said I'm going 
to fly for one million miles Michael said Wendy frowned It suddenly all seemed 
a bit too real and risky now that her brothers were involved but the sly Peter 
knew how to make her come along Did I tell you about the mermaids he said 
Mermaids Wendy breathed Mermaids were even more exciting than fairies and 
pirates Peter added Let's go at once said John Mr. and Mrs. Darling were 
almost home but they were not close enough from the middle of the street 
they gasped as they looked up at the bedroom window Beyond the curtain the 
room was ablaze with light Inside they could see three little shadows 
whirling around and around not on the floor but incredibly in the air 
No not three figures but four The stars still watching from up above called 
out a warning Peter The grown-ups are coming back There was no time to lose 
Peter threw open the window Come on he cried soaring into the night 
John Michael and Wendy followed Still on the street Mr. and Mrs. Darling and 
Nana watched in horror as their three little birds left the nest and were gone

Chapter The Long Flight 
Second to the right and then straight on until morning 
Wendy remembered what Peter had said but it seemed that even birds carrying 
street maps and consulting them at windy corners couldn't have found 
Neverland with those directions and so Michael and Wendy and John had no 
choice but to follow Peter and to trust him completely 
He led them around in circles flying past church spires and clock towers and 
any other tall object that struck his fancy John and Michael didn't mind They 
were having too much fun flying over the ocean racing each other between waves 
Wendy however was worried It seemed to her that they had been flying for days 
now Was the island called Neverland because they would never land It certainly 
seemed a possibility She was relieved at least that Peter was feeding them 
although his way of doing so was rather strange He would chase birds that had 
food in their mouths and steal it The birds would then steal it back and so it 
went like this for a while until someone managed to gobble the food down
Worst of all the children were getting incredibly sleepy Occasionally one of 
them would fall asleep while flying and drop like a heavy stone toward the 
cruel sea below It always turned out all right Either the other children would 
shout Wake up or Peter would swoop down at the last minute to save the falling 
child but they each came awfully close to the water a few times
One of these days Wendy thought Peter might let them fall just for the fun of 
it because it would be an interesting sight to see Don't make him mad Wendy 
whispered to John What would we do if he left us We would go back John said 
We don't know the way Well then we would go on said John We don't know that 
way either In fact we don't even know how to stop flying John thought about 
this Wendy was right Peter had never shown them how to stop Well he said 
worse comes to worst we could always just keep going The world is round after 
all Eventually we would get back to our bedroom window don't you think 
Peter was nowhere to be found It wasn't uncommon for him to leave them 
occasionally Easily bored and distracted he would fly up high to talk to the 
stars or down low to talk with a mermaid He always came back but sometimes he 
seemed barely to remember them as if he had already moved on to his next 
adventure I'm Wendy Wendy had reminded him once when he had flown back and 
looked at her blankly I know that Peter had said but she could tell he was 
lying Eventually the children learned how to fall asleep without falling 
Peter however found this boring so he would cry out and wake them up anyway 
just to see them jump At last they reached Neverland less due to Peter's 
guidance it seemed to Wendy than through sheer luck or perhaps because the 
island had been looking for them There it is Peter said He gestured in the 
direction the sun was shining like a hundred golden arrows pointing to the 
island Look there's the coral reef and the tiny hut and the cave cried John 
and my lagoon with the flying flamingos and there's the hunchbacked little old 
lady and the turtles laying their eggs and the sewing gnomes Michael added 
and my flamingo with the flying lagoons Hello Wolfie Wendy called down to her 
pet wolf Hello boat The children also saw and recognized the scary first days 
at school trying not to laugh at church the pop quizzes they hadn't studied 
for the tooth fairy money and the delicious chocolate pudding It was all so 
familiar Peter was a little annoyed with the children for knowing so much 
about the island He wanted to be the one who knew everything Shortly however 
the sun went down and the children got scared Then Peter felt better because 
they needed him again Down below black shadows grew and strange noises could 
be heard Out in the open sky there were no night-lights or Nanas to keep a 
child safe The children were on their own
Huddling close to Peter they flew so low now that their toes occasionally 
brushed the ocean Something strange hung in the air All of them could sense it 
They don't want us to land Peter said Who are they Wendy whispered shuddering 
Peter wouldn't say Instead he said This island is full of pirates and their 
captain Hook is the biggest pirate of all The boys had been excited about the 
pirates but at the reality of them Michael began to cry and even John gulped 
Of course Hook's not quite as big as he used to be Peter added thanks to me 
During our last battle I chopped off his right hand with my sword Now he has 
an iron claw instead of fingers If you meet him you leave him to me got it Yes
Don't say yes Say Ay ay sir Every boy who serves under me has to say that Ay ay
sir John replied It occurred to John then that Tinker Bell's light might make 
it easier for the pirates to see them Tell her to go away at once Peter the 
children cried but he refused She gets scared and lonely too he said 
They compromised John would carry Tink in his hat which he would hold in his 
hand This worked for a while until John got tired and Wendy took over Don't 
think that this changes anything between us the still-jealous Tink clinked if 
only for Peter's benefit Suddenly the quiet black sky was split in two by a 
loud boom The noise echoed through the dark mountains 
It's their cannon John cried The pirates have fired it at us Is anyone shot 
I'm not Michael said but wait where were Peter and Wendy The wind from the 
cannon fire had carried Peter far out to sea and Wendy and Tink blew high up 
into the black sky Tink wasn't all bad but fairies are so small that they 
only have room for one feeling at a time When she was around Wendy the 
jealousy Tink felt could barely fit Seeing a chance to rid herself of Wendy 
Tink gestured for the girl to follow her What else could Wendy do all alone in 
the sky She flew trustingly after the fairy to meet her fate

Chapter Island Come True
As though it were a living breathing thing Neverland seemed to sense that 
Peter was almost home Like a puppy it strained and wiggled to meet him at the 
door Whenever Peter went away the island slowed The fairies slept late 
The wild animals nursed their babies The pirates and the lost boys and 
the Indians stopped fighting wars and just called one another names 
instead With his return however the whole place started to rumble as if a 
train were coming The lost boys set out to find Peter the pirates started 
looking for the lost boys the Indians began looking for the pirates and 
the wild animals started looking for the Indians All of them went around and 
around the island but at the same speed so they never met 
Let us take a moment to examine each group as it passes 
The first to come our way are the lost boys The number of lost boys varies 
If someone grows up which is against the rules he is kicked out
Right now there are six They wear bearskins and carry daggers and they creep 
through the bushes like soldiers in single file
Leading the group is Tootles Tootles has bad luck The biggest adventures 
always seem to happen whenever he steps around the corner for a snack 
When he returns he inevitably finds the boys putting on bandages after a 
brilliant and bloody fight He could be bitter about it but Tootles is the 
sweetest and humblest lost boy Next comes Nibs the best dressed of the lost 
boys followed by Slightly who can carve whistles out of wood and dances to 
his own tunes Slightly is also the most arrogant lost boy 
he sticks up his nose at everyone so much that sometimes you can see right up 
inside Curly is the fourth boy He is always getting into trouble and 
he has grown accustomed to taking the blame even for things he didn't do 
Last are the twins We will not describe them because no one can ever tell 
them apart anyway Instead let's move on to the pirates close behind on the 
boys' trail They are a scary looking bunch Leading their ragged group is the 
handsome Italian pirate Cecco who carved his name in blood on the back of the 
warden of the prison from which he had escaped Behind him is the giant 
tattooed Bill Jukes who once took six bullets before dropping the bag of gold 
pieces he'd been stealing Next are Cookson and Gentleman Starkey Starkey is 
the most polite of the pirates he always apologizes before stabbing anyone 
with his sword Then come the Irish pirate Smee and Noodler followed by a few 
more ruffians Somewhere in the middle of this dark and dangerous group is 
James Hook the most feared pirate of them all His hair is styled in long 
shiny black curls framing a sternly handsome face His eyes are deep and black 
and dead unless he is plunging his hook into someone in which case his eyes 
sparkle a bright and happy red Hook is a different breed of pirate from the 
rest of his crew Except at the sight of his own blood he is courageous He is a 
master storyteller He speaks beautifully and softly even when he is swearing 
and is never more sinister than when he is being polite
After the pirates come the Indians Creeping quietly like shadows they carry 
tomahawks and knives Among them is Tiger Lily the beautiful Indian princess 
whom none dare approach for fear that she will raise her hatchet to them 
Behind the Indians creep the beasts lions tigers bears and other animals 
The beasts are so hungry that their tongues are hanging out 
Finally there comes a giant crocodile He is hungry too but not for just any 
meat No he has a craving for something or rather someone very specific 
The boys stop first They are getting tired
I wish Peter would get home already and tell us how Cinderella ends Slightly 
said out of breath Tootles was about to respond when the boys heard the 
pirates walking and singing in the distance The lost boys had stopped but the
pirates were still coming Peter had trained the boys well and they knew 
exactly what to do In a flash they each ran to a nearby tree Instead of 
climbing up however the boys went down The trees were hollow each with a hole 
in it exactly as big as one of the boys and all leading to the same 
underground cave
Hook had heard about these tree-doors and thought it silly that each boy 
had his own tree for his purposes however it suited him just fine 
seven trees should be easier to find than one The pirates soon arrived in the 
clearing where the lost boys had just been While the others fanned out to 
continue their search Hook and Smee stayed behind I think I spotted that Nibs 
boy Captain Smee said Shall I run after him I could tickle him with my sword 
No Hook said I want them all especially their captain Peter Pan 
He cut off my arm and threw it to a passing crocodile His waved his iron 
claw in the air One of these days I'm going to shake his hand with this
Is that why you fear crocodiles Smee asked Not all crocodiles Hook replied 
Just that one It thought my arm was so tasty that it has followed me ever 
since licking its lips just waiting to eat the rest of me The only reason it 
has not caught me yet is that it swallowed a clock which ticks inside it 
I always hear the beast coming and run away One day that clock's battery 
will die Smee pointed out The ticking will stop Ay Hook agreed darkly sitting 
down on a mushroom It was a strangely warm mushroom Hook thought Standing up 
he pulled at the mushroom and discovered that its top easily came off 
The headless mushroom then started to smoke Why it wasn't a mushroom at all it 
was a chimney Down the chimney Hook heard voices It was the lost boys he had 
found their cave Looking around now he could also see holes in seven of the 
nearby trees The entrances I heard them say that Peter is away Smee whispered 
Hook smiled and nodded He carefully replaced the mushroom top He had a plan 
Let's return to the ship Hook said We will bake a cake for them and leave it 
on Marooners' Rock in the mermaid lagoon The boys are sure to find it and 
gobble it up and it will make them sick so that we can more easily capture 
them how Hook and Smee laughed as they walked back to the boat Soon however 
another sound replaced their laughter It was the sound of ticking Hook stopped 
short shuddering Run yelled Smee but Hook was already gone

Chapter The Wendy Bird
Unaware that the pirates had found their hiding place the boys waited for a 
while and then emerged from their underground cave Suddenly Nibs saw something 
in the sky Look at that white bird he said It sounds as if it is saying 
Poor Wendy It must be a Wendy bird It wasn't actually a bird that Nibs saw at 
all but poor Wendy herself flying up above Now the boys heard another sound 
It was the voice of Tinker Bell shrill and jealous She was no longer 
pretending to be nice to Wendy but was pinching her and trying to make her 
fall Peter wants you to shoot this white bird Tink called down to the boys 
Quick the boys cried Bows and arrows Tootles excitedly fitted an arrow to his 
bow Get out of the way Tink he shouted He fired and Wendy fluttered to the 
ground with an arrow in her breast I shot the Wendy bird Tootles bragged 
Peter will be so proud of me Silly donkey Tinker Bell clinked laughing at her 
trick before going to hide She knew she would be in trouble for urging poor 
Tootles to shoot Wendy Slightly frowned as he looked at Wendy That is no bird 
he said I think it is a lady A lady Tootles replied nervously 
Peter was bringing a lady to take care of us and you've gone and killed her 
Curly said Tootles took a deep sad breath I did it I shot the Wendy-lady he 
said quietly and turned to leave the group Just then the boys heard a crowing 
sound up above it was Peter's signal He was back They gathered around Wendy so 
that Peter would not see her He dropped to the ground in front of them but no 
one said a word Why so quiet boys Peter asked but still none of the boys spoke 
Never mind Peter said I have news I've brought you back a mother You may even 
have seen her already I think she was flying this way Tootles cleared his 
throat Boys he said bravely step aside The boys obeyed revealing Wendy's body 
Peter bent took the arrow from Wendy's heart and turned to face his band of 
boys Whose arrow is this he asked sternly Mine Peter Tootles replied Angrily 
Peter raised the arrow prepared to hit Tootles with it but he couldn't do it 
at just that moment Nibs saw Wendy move The Wendy-lady he cried She moved her 
arm Peter bent over Wendy again and saw the acorn he had given to her when 
she'd asked for a kiss It was on a string around her neck The arrow had hit 
the acorn and saved her life Hurry up and get better he said so I can 
introduce you to the boys and the mermaids From her hiding spot up above Tink 
sighed loudly Listen to Tink crying because the Wendy-lady is alive 
Curly said The boys told Peter about her crime We are not friends anymore 
Peter cried Go away and never come back
Frantically Tinker Bell flew onto Peter's shoulder and begged his forgiveness 
but he brushed her off Lying on the ground Wendy stirred slightly She was 
waking up I'll be all right she said wearily You don't have to banish her 
Well all right Peter told Tinker Bell You can come back but not for a whole 
week You would think Tinker Bell would be grateful to Wendy for defending her 
but Wendy's generosity only made Tink want to pinch her even more Wendy in the 
meantime was so tired and sore from her hard fall that she rolled onto her 
side and fell asleep I have an idea Peter said Let's build Wendy a house
The boys were thrilled they loved to build They were incredibly quick 
carpenters too scurrying around for firewood branches and twigs and 
looking for soft cushiony flowers to use for her bedding Just then John and 
Michael dropped from the sky They had been sleep-flying but they woke up as 
soon as they hit the ground Mama Michael cried rubbing his eyes Nana Where are 
we John asked Are we dreaming Finally the boys spotted Peter Oh hello 
Peter said distractedly He had forgotten all about them Using his feet as a 
ruler he bent to measure Wendy to see how big her new house should be
Come on he told her brothers We are building a house for Wendy and you have to 
help I don't see why Wendy should get her own house John said She's only a 
girl She's going to be our mother Curly said Now you heard Peter get to work 
Wendy moved and groaned a bit in her sleep Slightly Peter cried Go get a doctor 
Slightly said and left at once before remembering that there were no doctors 
on the island Still he knew better than to disobey Peter so he returned 
wearing John's hat and looking very serious Although the other boys knew that 
Slightly was just pretending Peter did not to him make-believe was the same 
thing as true and so convinced that Slightly was in fact a doctor he said 
Help this lady She is very ill I will give her some medicine said Slightly 
bending over the sleeping Wendy and pretending to do just that and there 
she is cured What a relief Peter said While Wendy slept the boys built her 
house around her They knew she would love it because as she slept she sang 
I wish I had a pretty house the smallest ever seen with bright and shiny 
reddish walls and a roof of mossy green as they worked the boys sang back 
We've built your walls and mossy roof and made a lovely door So tell us now 
Wendy mother do you want something more Still sleeping Wendy sang 
Well since you ask I'd surely grin for windows all about with daffodils 
peeping in and babies peeping out And so the boys built windows and pulled 
flowers for Wendy but they weren't quite sure what to do about the babies 
Let's just pretend that part they said When they were finished the house was 
beautiful and Wendy was completely contained inside They were about to go 
inside to surprise her when they realized they had forgotten to put a knocker 
on the door Silly donkeys Tinker Bell cried from above Tootles gave the sole 
of his shoe to hang on the door which did the trick Now there was nothing left 
to do but knock Everyone stand up straight Peter warned and be on your best 
behavior He knocked politely and all of the boys waited When Wendy opened the 
door blinking sleepily the boys whipped off their hats and bowed 
Where am I she said confused and surprised The boys practically tumbled over 
one another to explain We built you this house Slightly said Do you like it 
asked Nibs It's lovely she said looking around How did you know it's exactly 
what I wanted just clever I guess said Slightly He saw no need to tell her 
what she had been singing in her sleep Can we be your children the twins asked 
Well Wendy said that's awfully nice of you but I am only a child myself I have 
no real experience That's okay Peter said although he actually knew less about 
mothers than any of them We just need a nice motherly person You'll do 
Wendy agreed to try and invited all the boys into her new house as they 
gathered around she did her first motherly thing and told them the end of 
Cinderella When she was finished she followed the boys to their cave and 
tucked them in for the evening before returning to her own home

Chapter Something Worse Than the Night
The next morning the Darling children were measured for their trees Hook if 
you recall thought it silly to have one tree for each lost boy but it 
actually made a great deal of sense Each different-size boy had a door that 
fit him as perfectly as a tailored suit This way they could all enter the cave 
at once without having to wait in line More important no other body except 
each lost boy's exact body could fit in that particular tree This was 
especially helpful in case of sneak pirate attacks
After a few days' practice the Darling children became very quick and 
graceful about using their trees To enter the cave they sucked their breath 
in and down they went at exactly the right speed To rise they sucked in and 
blew out and so wiggled up 


They also grew to love their new underground home It was simple and sweet a 
bit like camping Even Wendy stayed there now It was lonely in her own house 
and this felt so much more like a real family The cave was one large cozy 
room with a floor made of dirt The boys used mushrooms as chairs and a 
sawed-off tree trunk as a table There was one big bed on which all the boys 
except Michael slept packed in like sardines in a tin Because space was so 
tight there was a strict rule against turning around until one boy gave the 
signal and then everyone had to turn at once
Michael could have slept in the bed too there was always room in Neverland 
for one more but he was the littlest and Wendy liked to pretend that he was 
her baby so she hung him in a basket next to her bed Her pet wolf who 
followed her everywhere slept on the floor guarding them both 
Tinker Bell also lived in the cave in a tiny space carved into the wall no 
larger than a bird cage Over the entrance to her room hung a curtain that she 
could pull shut when she wanted privacy Small as it was Tink's room was the 
fanciest part of the whole cave filled with the finest fabrics soft tiny 
bedspreads and delicately carved antique furniture
Your house may be bigger Tinker Bell informed Wendy but mine is better 
Still Wendy had bigger concerns than whether Tink's house was better The boys 
kept her so busy cooking and cleaning and sewing that weeks would sometimes go 
by before she left the cave and saw daylight It makes one long for the old 
single life she thought wistfully as a real grownup might 
As for her parents she missed them and worried about them but there was 
something about Neverland that made time and those worries blur Somehow she 
was confident that the bedroom window and her parents' arms would always 
remain open for her to fly back into
What did disturb Wendy however was the fact that John was starting to forget 
their parents and Michael had already forgotten them entirely He actually 
thought she was his real mother to fix this Wendy set up a little school with 
their old life as the subject instead of spelling or math The other boys 
wanted to go to school too so she let them sit in Of course they always 
failed the quizzes especially the ones with hard questions like What color 
are Mother's eyes How did we spend last Christmas and Describe Father's laugh
Peter never came to school or took a quiz He said it was because he despised 
mothers and holidays and even sometimes laughs but really it was that he 
couldn't read or write While the other boys were in school Peter would go off 
alone Whether he went on real or imaginary adventures Wendy could never tell 
unless she or one of the other boys had also gone and with Peter sometimes 
not even then But Wendy had many of her own adventures Which such tale would 
you now like to hear The night attack by the Indians on the underground cave 
when a few of them got stuck in the hollow trees like fat Santas in chimneys 
Or perhaps the time Peter saved Tiger Lily's life in the mermaid lagoon and so 
made her a lifelong friend
Maybe I should tell you instead about the cake the pirates baked and kept 
leaving around to make the boys sick but which Wendy kept finding and 
snatching from the hands of her children until it got stale and they didn't 
want it anymore and Hook eventually tripped over the hard stale lump in the 
dark stubbing his toe 
I could tell you about the birds that were Peter's friends especially the 
Never bird who lived in the tree above the lagoon and how her nest fell in the 
water once but she kept sitting on it anyway to protect her eggs and Peter 
gave orders that no one was to disturb her
A shorter lagoon adventure and almost as exciting was Tinker Bell's attempt 
with the help of some other fairies to float a sleeping Wendy back to the 
mainland on a leaf until Wendy woke up and swam back to Neverland foiling 
Tink again Perhaps the best way to choose is simply to toss a coin and so the 
lagoon has won 
If you are lucky when you close your eyes at night you will sometimes see a 
lovely lagoon where the mermaids live and sing their beautiful songs When you 
are awake the nearest you can get to this lagoon is the beach at sunset in the 
surf The children spent long summer days at the lagoon swimming or lazily 
floating Much to Wendy's disappointment the mermaids turned out to be as 
unfriendly as Tinker Bell When they weren't splashing her with their tails 
they ignored her entirely
The mermaids didn't like the boys either except of course Peter Peter spent 
hours talking to the mermaids or sitting on their tails when they got 
particularly cheeky The lagoon was most beautiful at night when the moon 
came up and the mermaids began to sing their strange wailing songs to lure 
sailors onto the rocks but it was not a safe place for humans then 
Wendy knew this and made sure that she always gathered her children and 
left before dark On this day however as they were all dozing on Marooners' 
Rock after lunch something strange and frightening happened It wasn't night 
yet at least Wendy didn't think it was but the lagoon seemed to shift around 
them Little shivers ran over the water and shadows replaced the sun 
It was not night that had come It was something worse

Chapter The Mermaid Lagoon
Wendy probably should have woken the children at once but she was a young 
mother and it had not yet been half an hour since they had eaten Even when she 
heard the sound of muffled oars she did not wake them although she was so 
scared that her heart seemed to leap into her throat Instead she stood guard 
over them while they digested Peter however who was snoozing on the rock as 
well could smell danger even in his sleep at the sound of the oars he jumped 
to his feet as alert as a dog and quickly woke the boys
Pirates he whispered Just that one awful word The others huddled close around 
him Dive he cried Now There was a flash of legs and all of the boys were in 
the water They hid as best they could while the pirate dinghy pulled up to 
the rock they had just been sitting on in the boat were Smee and Starkey and 
their captive the Indian princess Tiger Lily
The pirates had caught her trying to sneak aboard their ship with a knife and 
had tied her hands and ankles They were going to leave Tiger Lily on the rock 
to drown when the tide came up and covered it She did not beg a true princess 
she sat up straight and stared proudly ahead in her dark watery hiding spot 
Wendy cried She had never witnessed such cruelty or bravery Peter had seen 
plenty of both and was not particularly moved What he did hate however was 
unfairness and this was two against one it would have been easy for him to 
wait until the pirates were gone to rescue Tiger Lily but Peter never chose 
the easy way out Ahoy there you rascals he cried out in his best imitation of 
Captain Hook's voice Captain the two pirates called back squinting into the 
darkness He must be swimming out to us Starkey said We are putting Tiger Lily 
onto the rock Smee called Set her free immediately was the surprising answer 
or I'll plunge my hook into you both The command made no sense to the pirates 
but they were afraid to disobey their captain They cut Tiger Lily's cords 
and with one last look she slid into the water like a graceful eel 
Boat ahoy Hook yelled suddenly Only this time it was the real Hook who was 
apparently also in the water and swimming toward the boat 
Wendy and Peter watched from the dark water as Hook used his metal claw to 
grip the side of the boat and pull himself aboard From the light of the 
pirates' lantern Wendy could see his roughly handsome face She wanted 
desperately to swim away but Peter signaled for her to stay put
Once on board Hook sat with his head in his hands groaning in extreme 
frustration Captain what's wrong Smee asked It's over Hook said sighing 
The lost boys have found a mother Wendy puffed up with pride floating now a 
little higher evil day Starkey said What's a mother asked Smee 
Just then the nest belonging to the Never bird floated by with the mother bird 
still sitting on it That is a mother and a good example of one at that 
Hook told Smee Her nest fell into the water but has she deserted her eggs 
No There was a break in Hook's voice as if for one moment he was recalling 
his childhood and his own mother But he brushed away this weakness and what 
might have been a small tear with his hook
Captain I propose we kidnap the boys' mother and make her our own Smee 
suggested Yes Hook said We will capture the boys and make them walk the plank 
Then we will keep their mother Smee and Starkey cheered 
Wait Hook said suddenly remembering Tiger Lily Where's the princess 
We let her go Smee replied Why Hook demanded Why you told us to Smee 
stammered I heard you too Captain Starkey said 
What kind of trickery is going on here thundered Hook I gave no such order 
He looked around and shivered Dark spirit that haunts the lagoon tonight 
he called out do you hear me I hear you Peter replied in Hook's own voice 
Hook was brave but Smee and Starkey hugged each other shaking Who are you 
Hook called out I am James Hook replied the voice captain of the Jolly Roger 
No you aren't Hook screamed angrily Yes I am the voice insisted 
If you are Hook Hook said trying to sound friendly then who am I 
You are a codfish Peter said promptly Smee and Starkey were slightly stupid 
and proud a bad combination A codfish they muttered Have we been 
taking orders all this time from a mere fish 
Hook barely heard them It was not their lack of faith in him that most 
bothered him but suddenly his lack of faith in himself 
He felt his ego slipping away from him Don't desert me he whispered to it 
hoarsely
Hook Hook asked cleverly do you have another voice Peter could never resist a 
game so he answered in his own voice I do and another name Yes 
Are you an animal vegetable or mineral Hook asked Yes no and no Peter replied 
Are you a man Hook tried next No Peter practically spit A boy then Yes an 
ordinary boy Wendy wanted to play too He is a wonderful boy she shouted out 
giggling Hook was stumped You can't guess you can't guess Peter bragged 
Give up in Peter's pride the pirates saw their chance
Yes we give up they cried Tell us who you are I'm Peter Pan Peter yelled out 
laughing Instantly Hook was himself once more and Smee and Starkey his 
faithful crew Get him Hook roared Dead or alive Quickly Peter whistled for his 
own crew The lost boys were resting in various parts of the lagoon 
We're coming Peter they cried The fight was short but sharp Swords flew in the 
water and air followed by many wheezes and whoops and wails as the two 
pirates and the lost boys clashed Hook and Peter had their own private battle 
to fight They met not in the water but on the rock which they both 
coincidentally climbed at the same time from opposite sides It was so dark 
that they didn't see each other until they were almost in the middle 
nose-to-nose
Peter grabbed a knife from Hook's belt and was about to finish him off 
when he noticed that he was higher up on the rock than Hook This would not 
have been fighting fair so Peter offered Hook a hand to hoist himself up 
Hook was not a similar fan of fighting fair He leaned over and bit Peter in 
response It was not the pain of the bite but the pain and surprise of the 
unfairness that dazed Peter making him quite helpless All children are 
affected like this the first time they realize the world is unfair People 
had been unfair to Peter before but he had always forgotten it and so he 
reacted as if it were the first time Hook clawed Peter twice with his hook and 
might have finished him off had he not just then heard a ticking Instead Hook 
slid immediately into the water swimming madly for his ship

Chapter The Never Bird

Out on the water the lost boys had won their fight with Smee and Starkey but 
they couldn't find Peter or Wendy or Hook Taking the pirates' dinghy they 
sailed home in it shouting for Peter and Wendy the entire time but there was 
no response except for an occasional mocking from the mermaids 
They must be swimming or flying back the boys concluded Had they stayed in the 
lagoon they might have soon heard two voices crying for help Peter and Wendy 
he injured and she weak had climbed back onto Marooners' Rock as the water 
rose dangerously around them they fell unconscious one right after the other 
a mischievous mermaid pulled Wendy by her toe trying to get her into the water 
Feeling her slip from him Peter woke up just in time to pull her back 
Our rock is shrinking he told her Soon it will be gone Let's go then Wendy 
cried We can swim or fly away I can do neither Peter replied I have been 
injured You go but Wendy was too weak to make it on her own The children 
put their hands over their eyes to shut out the sight of the rising water and 
prepared to meet their end Just then something brushed Peter's leg It was as 
light as a feather and it seemed to be asking Can I help What luck It was the 
tail of a kite which Michael had made a few days earlier but then lost to the 
wind Peter grabbed it and wrapped it around Wendy Now you Wendy cried 
It can't lift us both Peter explained Michael and Curly tried
Wendy clung to Peter refusing to go without him but he pushed her from the 
rock and away she flew Peter was left all alone in the lagoon 
The rock grew smaller and smaller in the distance the mermaids called sadly 
to the moon Like any boy Peter was scared to die but soon his fear changed to 
excitement to die will be an awfully big adventure he said
Around him the lagoon grew quieter and quieter Peter heard the mermaids saying 
goodnight to one another and shutting the doors to their coral caves 
He heard the water gurgle greedily as it rose to nibble on the rock Then he 
saw something white floating on the water He thought it was a piece of paper 
or perhaps a piece of Michael's kite but as he continued to stare at it he 
realized that it had a more definite sense of purpose than a mere piece of 
paper would have It seemed to be fighting the tide instead of just going with 
the flow Peter found himself rooting for the white streak to win 
The piece of paper was actually the Never bird still sitting on her
now-floating nest She was trying desperately to reach Peter Although he had 
teased her in the past he had also given orders that her nest was not to be 
disturbed for this reason and perhaps because she was above all things a 
mother she would disturb her nest herself to save his life Swim to the nest 
she called to him I am too tired to row all the way to you but Peter didn't 
speak bird language and couldn't understand her and even near death he 
could be very impatient What are you quacking about Peter asked rudely 
I don't understand a word Why I never the Never bird said and tried again 
Same to you Peter replied Whatever you just said Remembering that he was only 
a child the maternal Never bird took a deep breath and made one last push to 
row her nest to the rock Upon reaching it she flew up leaving her eggs 
behind to make some room for Peter Finally realizing her meaning Peter waved 
his thank-you to the Never bird Looking down however he saw there was not 
enough room in the nest for both him and her two large white eggs 
He lifted the eggs up and the Never bird covered her eyes with her feathers 
afraid of what Peter might do On the rock next to Peter was a waterproof hat 
broad and wide which Starkey had left behind Peter put the eggs into the 
hat and set them afloat With a final happy quack the Never bird swooped down 
and settled herself on top of her eggs Peter got into the Never bird's old 
nest waved good-bye and pushed off He in his nest and Wendy with her kite 
arrived back at the cave at nearly the same time Oh how everyone rejoiced 
The party went on until Wendy realized how late it was and told everyone it 
was well past their bedtime The boys tried to stall insisting they were 
injured and in need of slings and bandages but Wendy would have none of it 
and sent them to bed


Chapter
The Happy Family On the night that would come to be known as the night of all 
nights the children ate a make believe dinner Unfortunately their hunger was 
real and as a result they were noisy and misbehaving Be quiet Wendy yelled 
finally for she was hungry and grumpy too is your plate empty Slightly 
Slightly looked down at his imaginary plate Not quite Mommy He didn't take 
one bite of his carrots Nibs said John raised his hand Since Peter isn't here 
can I sit in his chair Sit in Father's chair No replied Wendy who had taken to 
referring to Peter as Father He's not our real father John complained Tootles 
wanted in too Can I be the father he asked No Wendy said What about the baby 
he asked I'm the baby Michael said He was already settled in his comfortable  
basket Tootles moped Slightly has his elbows on the table someone reported 
The twins ate their dessert before their vegetables someone else added Curly 
is eating all the butter and honey Nibs is speaking with his mouth full
Wasn't this just like normal family life Later after the imaginary dishes 
were washed Wendy sat by the fire and sewed socks with very real holes in them 
as her boys played around her she felt very content with her familiar little 
family Just one thing was missing Suddenly she heard a step above them That's 
Peter's step Wendy said Children go greet Father at the door Peter entered 
dropping down through his own personal tree and the children ran to him 
happily He had brought nuts and treats for them and from the crocodile the 
correct time for Wendy This he obtained by following the crocodile until he 
chimed the hour You spoil us Peter Wendy said We want to dance the twins 
cried Go ahead said Peter who was in a jolly mood You and Mommy too Come on 
Peter Wendy said Children, go put your nightgowns on first While the boys 
ran to do so Peter and Wendy had a quiet moment alone Life is good isn't it 
Peter said, warming his feet by the fire You and me and the little ones It is 
Wendy agreed I think Curly has your nose Michael takes after you Peter said 
but suddenly Peter looked scared Wendy he said This is all make-believe 
right I'm not really their father Wendy looked at him for a few seconds 
It's make-believe she finally said Whew Peter cried I can't tell you how 
relieved I am to hear that It would make me feel so old to be their 
real father and how do you feel about me Wendy asked Peter just blinked as if 
he didn't quite understand the question Wendy sighed and went to sit at the 
other end of the room with her back to him at that moment the boys came out 
and sang and danced for Peter and Wendy in their nightgowns When they had 
finished dancing the boys got into bed for Wendy's good-night story the story 
that they loved best and which Peter hated Usually when she told this story 
he put his hands over his ears or left the room Tonight however he stayed to 
listen Once upon a time there was a gentleman Wendy began I want a lady 
Curly said I want a white rat said Nibs Sh Wendy said Okay there was a 
lady as well Their names were Mr. and Mrs. Darling On the other side of the 
room Peter flinched Hey John said I know them Me too Michael said but he 
didn't sound sure Mr. and Mrs. Darling were married and had three White 
rats Nibs cried hopefully Children Wendy said and they had a nurse called 
Nana but one day Mr. Darling got mad at Nana and chained her up in the yard 
and so all the children flew away to Neverland That is a great story said Nibs 
Imagine how sad these parents were after their children left Wendy said Poor 
parents the boys moaned but they were just pretending to feel sorry It's an 
awfully sad story the first twin said cheerfully If you knew how strong a 
mother's love is you wouldn't worry Wendy said and now she came to the part 
that Peter hated the most You see Wendy said the mother left the window open 
so her children could fly back one day She closed her eyes Can't you see it 
Can't you picture the happy scene when the children finally fly back home 
from Peter's corner came a hollow groan are you in pain Wendy asked No but 
you are wrong about mothers He took a deep breath a long time ago I thought 
my mother would also keep the window open for me so I stayed away and played 
but when I flew back the window was locked She had forgotten all about me and 
another little boy was sleeping in my bed Is that true or make-believe Wendy  
asked alarmed Peter wasn't sure but it scared the children all the same So 
that is what mothers are like they thought Wendy let's go home right now John  
cried Maybe it's too late and the window's already locked Yes she said 
clutching her brothers She was so worried about the closed window that she 
didn't even think about Peter's feelings Peter will you arrange it If you 
like he replied coolly as if she had asked him to pass the nuts After all if 
she didn't care neither would he Upset at the idea of losing their mother the 
lost boys surrounded Wendy threateningly We won't let you go they cried We'll 
keep you prisoner Tootles help Wendy cried Somehow even though he was the 
silliest boy she knew he was the right person to ask Tootles stepped between 
her and the rest of the boys You'll have to go through me first he said 
Peter spoke up We keep no girls here against their will Since flying makes 
you so tired I'll have the Indians guide you through the woods Then Tink can 
take you across the sea Thank you Peter Wendy said She turned to the lost boys 
Come with us she offered I am sure my parents would adopt you This was meant 
mainly for Peter but all of the boys jumped with joy Peter can we go they 
pleaded If you like he repeated bitterly and they rushed to pack He however 
didn't move Go pack Peter Wendy said her voice low I'm not going he replied 
Then to show that he didn't care he skipped around the room singing but we can 
find your mother Wendy begged No I don't like mothers She would only tell me 
I have to grow up and stop having fun The other boys watched this exchange 
nervously Peter not coming What would they do Could they still go Did they 
want to Now then Peter said I'll have no fuss no blubbering good-byes It was 
a pleasure to meet you Wendy He held out his hand formally You'll take good 
care of yourself she asked Yes Ready Tinker Bell Tinker Bell groaned from her 
cave She resented having to help Wendy but at least the girl would finally be 
gone Then off you go at just that moment however there was a clashing sound 
above The pirates had attacked the Indians The trip home was off at least for 
now

Chapter Extremely Happy Hook 
The pirate attack was a complete surprise Hook had broken all of the rules the 
pirates and the Indians normally followed when they fought He attacked in 
neither the time nor the place that was allowed When it was over almost all 
of the Indians were injured Only Tiger Lily managed to escape unharmed 
Finished with the Indians the pirates still could not rest It was after all 
not the Indians they had come for The Indians were just bees to be smoked out 
so they could get to the honey The pirates wanted the lost boys and Wendy and 
most of all Peter Pan Peter was an awfully small boy to inspire such a big 
hatred in Hook even if he had thrown Hook's hand to the crocodile but there 
was something about him that enraged Hook It was more than Peter's courage or 
his cuteness It was his cockiness his absolute confidence in himself This is 
something many children have but most grownups have lost it entirely 
Perhaps Hook had lost some of his too and wanted it back The question was 
How could the pirates get down the hollow trees which were perfectly sized to 
allow each individual lost boy down but no one else Below the boys were 
still trying to figure out who had won the battle If it was the Indians they 
reasoned they will beat their tom-tom drums It is always their sign of 
victory Perched at the edge of the hollow trees up above the pirates heard 
this Smee happened to be sitting on a tom-tom which Hook ordered him to beat 
immediately After a moment of confusion Smee understood and smiled BANG BANG 
BANG went the tom-tom drum The tom-tom the pirates heard Peter cry The Indians 
have won Let's go up and celebrate with them The lost boys cheered and Hook 
ordered his men to take their positions and get ready for the boys to come up 
through their trees The first to emerge was Curly The pirates threw him 
around like a ball from Cecco to Smee then Starkey then Bill Jukes then 
Noodler One by one all of the boys were plucked from their trees and tossed 
around in this manner It was to say the least a different kind of flying than 
they were used to The pirates then gagged the boys and tied them up With 
Wendy the pirates behaved differently After all she was a lady or rather a 
little girl and even pirates have some manners When she emerged Hook offered 
her his arm and bowed so elegantly that she blushed When they tied her up 
they used the softest rope they had apologizing and making sure that they 
weren't hurting her When it came time to tie up Slightly however the pirates 
found that it took far more rope than it had for the other boys or Wendy 
It turned out that Slightly had been sneaking so many snacks lately that he 
had grown greatly In fact there had come a day when he no longer fit in his 
tree How had he gotten into and out of the cave Each night while the other 
boys slept he had secretly started to widen the hole in his tree Why are you 
so much bigger than the other boys Hook demanded Why you're practically as 
big as a grown-up While the pirates found extra rope with which to tie him 
up Hook had a brilliant idea He knew how he was going to get Peter who was 
still down in the cave He signaled for the other pirates to take the lost boys 
and Wendy to the ship and leave him alone to his plans Tiptoeing over to 
Slightly's tree Hook saw that it was now wide enough to let him through He 
listened for any sound from down below but all was quiet Was Peter asleep 
Was he waiting at the bottom of the tree with his dagger in his hand The only 
way to find out was to try Hook took a deep breath stepped into the tree and 
let himself fall When he hit the ground he crouched for a second waiting for 
his eyes to adjust to the dark of the underground cave Finally things began 
to take shape In the corner he saw the great bed and on it Peter sleeping 
For once Peter wasn't pretending He was unaware of what was happening up 
above He believed the Indians had won the battle and that the lost boys had 
gone up to celebrate with them He was happy for the Indians but the lost boys 
were going to leave him and Peter didn't feel like celebrating Oh he had 
pretended not to care but he was very sad and when he got sad he got sleepy 
Today he was so sleepy that he didn't even dream It was in this sad deep 
dreamless sleep that Hook found Peter as he stood over the bed and looked down 
Hook felt slightly sorry for the boy After all Peter was only a child and 
Hook wasn't completely evil but then Peter smiled in his sleep perhaps he was 
dreaming something after all and that smile seemed so arrogant it made Hook 
angry all over again Hook saw a glass of water on Peter's night table and 
knew exactly what to do in case he should ever be captured Hook always carried 
a small bottle of poison with him Taking it out of his pocket now he added a 
few drops to Peter's water Peter would wake up take a sip and fall to the 
ground dead With one last satisfied look back Hook climbed back up Slightly's 
tree Once above ground Hook tilted his captain's hat at a fashionable angle 
wound his dark cloak dramatically around himself and stole away through the 
forest

Chapter Carried Off
Peter slept for a long time Finally he was awakened by a soft rapping on the 
door of his tree When he opened his eyes it was still dark He felt for his 
sword Who is it he asked There was no answer only another knock I said who is 
it Still nothing only silence Peter was scared but also excited He loved 
adventures especially ones that placed him in danger His heart beat very fast 
I won't open unless you speak he said Let me in Peter the visitor finally 
said in a lovely bell-like voice it was Tinker Bell Peter quickly unlocked 
the door and she flew in her face flushed and her pretty dress stained with 
mud Tinker Bell told Peter that Wendy and the boys had been captured and were 
now prisoners on the pirate ship I must save her Peter cried, leaping for his 
weapons but first he would have a sip of the water Wendy had left by his bed 
His hand reached for the glass No Tinker Bell cried for she had heard Hook 
mutter about his trick as he sped through the forest It is poisoned What How 
by whom Hook Don't be silly How could Hook have gotten down here I don't know 
but he did Peter Pan was stubborn and thirsty so he raised his glass anyway. 
Tinker Bell flew quickly between his lips and the glass and took a sip of the 
water instead Hey that's my water Peter protested Tinker Bell did not answer 
She was already spinning dizzily in the air poisoned Tink Peter asked 
suddenly afraid You should have listened to me Tinker Bell said weakly Oh Tink 
why did you risk your life to save me Peter asked Her wings were weak but she 
managed to land gracefully on Peter's shoulder and give his nose one last 
loving pinch She whispered in his ear because I love you you silly donkey 
Then she flew weakly back to her little cave and collapsed on her bed Peter 
knelt near Tinker Bell's limp body in distress His head filled almost the 
entire space of her room Tink's light was growing darker Peter knew she would 
die if it went out entirely Oh Tink he cried what can I do I need you Please 
don't leave me now I think I could get well again if children believed in 
fairies Tinker Bell gasped but there were no children left in the cave Peter 
stood up straight and screamed out to all of the children in the universe to 
all who might be dreaming about Neverland boys and girls in their pajamas 
safe in their beds maybe even you Do you believe he cried and his question 
rang throughout the world Tink sat up weakly in bed and listened straining to 
hear her fate She and Peter thought they heard some voices but they weren't 
sure If you believe Peter tried next clap your hands Don't let Tink die This 
time they heard their answer many children clapping A few naughty nasty 
children hissed but mostly they clapped until that is the clapping suddenly 
stopped having been hushed by worried mothers who had rushed into bedrooms to 
find out what all the commotion was about Nevertheless that bit of clapping 
was enough Tinker Bell was saved Back to her old self she didn't even think of 
thanking the children who believed although she did want revenge on the few 
who had hissed Now we must rescue Wendy Peter vowed Oh if only some clapping 
could work that magic as well Yes yes we must always think of Wendy Tinker 
Bell said glumly It was a cloudy night not good weather for flying so Peter 
pressed forward on the ground in Indian fashion He could not help but 
notice that the island was strangely quiet as though it were still in shock 
from the recent battle as Peter walked he looked for things the boys might 
have dropped He had trained them if ever taken to leave such clues Slightly 
for example was to cut trees and Curly to drop seeds Wendy knew to drop her 
handkerchief but he saw nothing He swore a terrible oath Hook or me this time

Chapter The Pirate Ship 
The Jolly Roger lurked low in the water like a waiting crocodile the pirates 
sat on deck in the cool fog of the night playing cards or napping Hook could 
not play or rest Distracted he paced the deck It wasn't that he was unhappy 
After all Peter had been removed and the lost boys were soon to walk the plank 
and yet for some reason his happiness was incomplete like Mr. Darling Hook 
worried about things like breeding and class what he liked to call good 
form He too cared very much what people especially people with good form 
thought about him Whenever he did something or wanted something he would ask 
himself is it good form to do or want such a thing Sometimes he worried that 
it was not good form to think so much about good form but Hook wasn't just 
unhappy he was also lonely as hard as it was to believe Hook hurt He had no 
children to love him it was strange that this should bother him but it was 
true all the same In a way Hook envied Smee Smee was the least threatening of 
the pirates and yet the children loved him Michael had even tried on his 
spectacles Thinking about the children's preference for Smee made Hook angry 
and he decided to finish off the boys once and for all are the children tied 
up so they can't fly away he yelled Ay ay came the reply Well then hoist them 
up the boys were brought up on deck before him Six of you will walk the plank 
tonight Hook announced but I have room for two cabin boys Who will it be Which 
of you will come to work for me Tootles stepped forward I would sir but I 
don't think my mother would want me to be a pirate Would yours Slightly I 
don't think so Slightly said the twins agreed as did the others None of their 
mothers would approve Enough Hook cried He pointed to John You he said You 
look like you have a little pluck in you Do you want to be a pirate Secretly 
John had always dreamed of being a pirate He even had a pirate name picked 
out Red-Handed Jack in a low voice he now confessed this to Hook Why 
Red-Handed Jack is a fine name Hook said What would my name be if I joined 
Michael asked Blackbeard Joe Hook said Michael was impressed Will we still be 
respectful subjects of the king of England John asked No Hook replied You 
would have to swear Down with the king Oh John said his face falling He could 
never turn his back on England Well then never mind Then you shall walk the 
plank, too Hook roared The boys went pale as they saw Jukes and Cecco 
preparing the piece of wood off which they would walk before falling into the 
water but they tried to look brave especially when Wendy was brought up She 
was the brave one she emerged from belowdecks wearing a dark scowl are you 
ready to watch your boys walk the plank Hook asked her sweetly Do you have any 
last words for them I do Wendy replied in a loud clear voice I have a message 
from their real mothers and it is a hope that their sons will die bravely and 
with their heads held high like proper English gentlemen The boys all stood 
up a little higher trying to be brave to do this one last thing for their 
mothers and Wendy Tie her up to the mast Hook yelled and Smee obeyed I'll 
save you if you promise to be my mother Smee whispered to Wendy I would 
rather have no children at all she replied scornfully even though she had to 
admit that Smee was the nicest pirate of them all The boys tried to be brave 
as they were put on the plank in the end however they were only little boys 
and they could not stop themselves from shaking and shivering with fear Wendy 
turned her head She couldn't look Hook took a step toward her He wanted her to 
watch the boys walk one by one off the end of the plank but he never reached 
her He never got to hear her beg for the boys' lives Instead he heard tick 
tick tick it was the terrible tick he realized of the crocodile All eyes were 
suddenly on Hook it was almost a sad sight to see this brave pirate captain 
positively freeze in terror as the ticking sound came nearer and nearer Even 
his claw hung inactive as if it too were afraid Hook fell to the deck and 
crawled as far from the sound as he could go Hide me he begged and the pirates 
gathered grimly around him in the center of the boat The lost boys glanced 
over the side of the boat to look for the crocodile but to their surprise 
they saw Peter approaching instead He signaled them not to give any sign and 
kept on ticking and climbing 

Chapter Hook or Me This Time 
Odd things often happen without us even noticing Such was the case with 
Peter's ticking a few minutes earlier on his way to the boat Peter had passed 
by the crocodile and noticed that he was no longer making noise After a 
moment's thought he realized that the clock must have finally wound down 
Peter knew that the beasts on the island feared the crocodile and avoided the 
ticking sound Without even thinking about it he began to imitate the ticking 
so that he could pass through the forest unbothered the crocodile heard this 
and perhaps because he missed the sound he began to follow Peter As Peter 
swam newly ticking to the boat he had one thought about the upcoming battle 
Hook or me this time Only one of them would walk away alive he vowed One of 
the pirates spotted Peter as he was climbing up the side of the boat Before 
he could cry out John clamped his hands over the pirate's mouth the other 
boys quickly caught him and tossed him overboard with a gentle splash the 
pirates were now looking over the other side of the boat searching for the 
crocodile Peter who had temporarily stopped ticking tiptoed into a cabin 
belowdecks I think it's gone Captain Smee said Well then here's to Johnny 
Plank Hook cried in an even worse mood now because the boys had seen him scared 
He started to sing Yo ho yo ho the frisky plank you walks alone it so till 
it goes down and you goes down to the dark water below Hook paused Now tell me 
he said not unkindly Would you like a bit of a snack before you go There are 
some sandwiches in the cabin No the boys cried not only because they weren't 
hungry but because Peter was hiding in the cabin I can't very well send you 
off to the depths below on empty stomachs can I Hook asked Jukes go get the 
sandwiches Ay ay Jukes said and went inside Within seconds there was a 
dreadful cry from inside the cabin The cry was followed by a strange crowing 
sound which confused the pirates but which the boys understood perfectly What 
is that noise Hook asked Is that a bird Someone go check on Bill Jukes
The Italian Cecco went inside for a peek and then ran out pale Bill Jukes is 
gone he reported Gone the other pirates asked I can't see what it's too dark 
in there but there's something in there crowing Cecco said Go and bring it to 
me Hook demanded Don't make me Cecco cried but seeing Hook flex his claw 
Cecco obeyed Within seconds there was another screech and then more crowing 
Who's going to bring me that rooster Hook demanded Did you volunteer Starkey 
My hook seems to think you did I'd rather swing Starkey said in a low voice 
and the rest of the pirates mumbled their agreement Is this mutiny Hook said 
with Starkey as the ringleader He extended his claw Perhaps you would like to 
shake my hand Starkey he said Starkey looked around for help but found none 
Hook advanced with a gleam in his eye Before Hook could get him Starkey 
jumped on the pirates' cannon shimmied out to its edge and threw himself into 
the sea Never mind Hook muttered I'll go get that rooster myself a minute 
later Hook came staggering out without his lantern Something blew out my light 
he said shaking and Cecco is missing Pirates are a superstitious bunch and 
this was too much for them This ship's cursed one of them muttered Haunted the 
others agreed Knowing it was Peter Michael giggled Hook noticed this It gave 
him an idea Open the cabin door and push the lost boys in he suggested If they 
kill the bird so much the better and if it kills them we're none the worse 
We're going to kill them anyway The boys pretended to cry and struggle as they 
were pushed inside Now let's listen Hook said and the pirates all crowded 
around the door Meanwhile Peter had found the key to unlock the boys' chains 
They looked for weapons while Peter snuck out through an opposite porthole 
and cut Wendy's bonds They could have flown away but Peter had vowed that it 
was Hook or him this time He told Wendy to go hide with the boys wrapped 
himself in her cloak and took her place on the mast Then he took a deep breath 
and crowed The pirates were terrified Had the crow killed all the boys Would 
it kill them next Lads Hook suggested perhaps our run of bad luck is due to 
the lady we have on board Let's get rid of her and see if our luck changes 
Throw her overboard the pirates cried and rushed at the figure in the cloak 
There's no one who can save you now the pirates hissed There's one person the 
figure at the mast replied in a strangely low voice Peter Pan as he spoke 
Peter threw off the cloak and revealed his face Suddenly everyone understood 
what was happening Get him Hook cried but not very convincingly He sensed that 
Peter was about to best him once again and it was too much for him Hook's 
fierce heart broke Fight Peter cried The boys burst out of the cabin and a 
fierce battle with the pirates began The pirates were stronger but the boys 
were smarter and fought in pairs Some of the pirates jumped overboard while 
others ran away and hid Finally only Hook was left The boys surrounded him 
Even alone he was strong and brave and kept them away using nothing but his 
hook He lifted one boy up with it and used him as a shield Peter jumped into 
the circle Stand back he cried This man is mine For a long time the enemies 
just looked at each other So Hook said This is all your doing It is Peter 
crowed Cocky arrogant boy Hook said Prepare to meet your end and you Peter 
cried a dramatic sword fight followed during which both man and boy fought 
bravely Finally Hook moved to get Peter with his iron hand Peter ducked and 
lunged with his sword piercing Hook in the ribs Hook stared down at the wound 
in surprise as you may recall the only blood he could not stand to look at was 
his own He dropped his sword Now the boys cried It was time to finish Hook 
off They lunged forward but Peter put up his hand stopping them Pick up your 
sword he told Hook who obeyed What are you Hook asked How is it possible that 
you have beaten me You cannot be just an ordinary boy I am not an ordinary 
boy Peter said I am youth I am joy I am a little bird that just escaped its 
shell and above all I am fair Hook narrowed his eyes Enough he said Back to 
the fight He swung his sword around wildly Anyone else would have been hit but 
Peter ducked as if the wind were working to protect him blowing him just the 
right distance this way and that Desperate Hook ran off and returned with a 
grenade In two minutes he cried when he returned this ship will be blown to 
bits but Peter just picked up the grenade and threw it overboard Hook hated 
how calmly and bravely Peter was behaving Peter was showing could it possibly 
be good form The thought of this was too much to bear as the boys drew closer 
Hook barely even saw them His mind was elsewhere back in his school days when 
he had first learned of good form Seeing Peter advancing with his sword Hook 
turned and stood at the edge of the boat looking down at the sea He saw that 
the crocodile was there waiting for him Peter kicked him overboard as Hook 
fell he realized much to his delight that this kick was actually very bad 
form Feeling superior Hook went happily to the crocodile With the fight at 
last over Wendy emerged from the cabin below The boys danced around her 
pointing out all of the places where they had fought Yes yes you are very 
brave boys Wendy said but it's past your bedtime Let's get into the pirates' 
bunks messy as they are and get some rest All of the boys went down to sleep 
except Peter He fell asleep up on deck next to the pirates' cannon Wendy sat 
next to him the whole time softly rubbing his head to protect him from bad 
dreams

Chapter The Return Home
Everyone woke up early next day It was a very long journey back home and the 
sea was quite rough so the going would be slow with slight alterations from 
Wendy the pirates' clothes fit the boys just fine pants cut off at the knees 
and jaunty hats and eye patches The scowls they added themselves Peter of 
course was the captain Nibs and John were first and second mates None of the 
boys had any training in sailing a pirate ship but they pretended they did 
which in Neverland is always enough as they worked securing jibs and sheets 
and all sorts of other sailor words they sang and cheered heartily Finally 
they got the ship out into the open sea let loose her sails and started for 
England It was time Peter had decided that they would sail as far as the Azore 
Islands and then fly the rest of the way He stood at the wheel and addressed 
his pirate crew You scum he cried You mangy dogs There will be no mutiny on 
my ship or else The boys knew that Peter was only pretending to be a pirate 
but unlike them he couldn't always tell the difference He was even wearing 
Hook's old clothes and so they laughed but nervously Let us leave the boys on 
the boat and travel back to the Darlings' home It seems a shame to have 
neglected it all this time But Mrs. Darling wouldn't have wanted us to focus 
on her when we could instead be keeping an eye on her little ones It would 
serve those naughty children right if their beds were not made and their room 
was all dusty and their parents weren't even home having forgotten all about 
them Of course this is not the case and this is the kind of thing children 
count on so they can have their adventures The only difference from when they 
left is that Nana is no longer chained Mr. Darling could admit when he was 
wrong The second the children had flown he had invited Nana back into the 
house where she had stayed Then however he had done a most unusual thing He 
had gone down on all fours and crawled into Nana's kennel himself Mrs. Darling 
had begged him to come out but he had said Not until the children come back 
Every morning the kennel was carried with Mr. Darling in it to the office and 
then back again at night This is my punishment and it is proper he thought 
Given how much he cared what other people thought of him it was a hard 
punishment indeed People laughed and pointed peering inside and he became 
known as Darling in the Kennel The true beauty of his sacrifice however soon 
shone through When the public learned why he had confined himself to Nana's 
kennel they began to follow him not to laugh but to praise Girls asked for his 
autograph Society types invited him to dinner in his kennel and black tie of 
course KENNEL one headline in the papers read THE NEW GOOD FORM It was what he 
had always wanted and yet Mr. Darling could not enjoy his new status in the 
community Mrs. Darling was sad as well when she managed to fall asleep usually 
in her chair by the fire she would dream of her children this night was no 
different tonight however let us whisper in her ear that the children are on 
their way home but perhaps we should not because she was wakened with a start 
calling out their names there is a chill in the air but the Darlings would 
never dare close the window it must always stay open for the children little 
do they know that at this moment there is someone at that window it is Peter 
he has flow ahead with Tinker Bell Open Peter muttered bitterly upon seeing 
the window I knew it would be Peter came up with one final plan he would fly 
in quietly so not to wake Mr. Darling in his kennel lock the window and then 
sneak through the front door that way when Wendy and the boys arrived they 
would think their parents had forgotten about them and they would have to come 
back to Neverland oh this is a brilliant idea he though he didn't care about 
Wendy's or her mother's feelings only about what he wanted children can be 
selfish that way on his way back out of the house however Peter passed Mrs. 
Darling sleeping by the fire seeing the dried tears on her puffy face he felt 
guilty for the first time I need her too he wanted to shout we can't both have 
her he jumped and sang and made funny faces but as hard as he tried he 
couldn't get poor Mrs. Darling's tears out of his head Maybe he was growing up 
a bit after all The thought enraged him Oh fine he huffed C'mon Tink They 
unbarred the window and flew away Moments later the children found the house 
and the open window They landed softly on their old bedroom floor Michael 
didn't even recognize the place This looks familiar he said Of course silly 
it's our room said John There's Nana's kennel Wendy cried and they all rushed 
to look inside but in place of Nana they saw a man It's Father Wendy said 
Let me see a father Michael begged He didn't remember his father he said a 
little disappointed The pirates were bigger It is a good thing Mr. Darling was 
asleep and didn't hear his son for it would have broken his heart Did he 
always sleep in the kennel John asked confused Suddenly Wendy couldn't 
remember either Just then they heard the piano downstairs Mother Wendy gasped 
Aren't you our mother Michael asked Oh dear Wendy said Perhaps they had waited 
too long to come back Let's go downstairs and surprise her John suggested We 
can yell boo Let's be a bit gentler Wendy said We owe her that much Let's get 
into our beds and she'll come in and find us and that is exactly what they did

Chapter Growing up and Good-Byes
The next morning Mrs. Darling walked into her children's bedroom and there 
they were her babies sound asleep as though they had never left for a moment 
she thought she must have imagined them leaving in the first place If it were 
not for Mr. Darling asleep in his kennel she wouldn't have been sure Of course 
the children were only pretending to sleep Unable to stand the suspense any 
longer they leaped from their beds screaming and ran to hug and kiss their 
mother at the commotion Mr. Darling crawled sleepily out of his kennel Nana 
came running into the room as well Outside watching the Darling family reunion 
from a nearby tree a little boy named Peter Pan shed a tear He would never 
know such happiness he thought The other lost boys were a different story 
Wendy had hidden them downstairs but she summoned them now She made them stand 
in a row in front of her mother She wished they were not all still wearing 
their pirates' clothes Please take us in the little pirates begged We don't 
eat a lot Nibs said Of course we will have you Mrs. Darling cried at once but 
Mr. Darling frowned It's an awful lot of boys he said Really he just wished 
Mrs. Darling had not answered without asking him I just wish people wouldn't 
treat me like a nobody in my own house he explained We don't think you are a 
nobody Tootles cried and the others all agreed You are everything to me Mrs. 
Darling whispered to him Happy Mr. Darling said he supposed they could make 
room somehow as for Peter he was still outside lingering Wendy saw him and 
walked over to the window Oh hello he said casually as if running into Wendy 
were a mere coincidence Peter Wendy said Please come inside My parents will 
adopt you too Mrs. Darling came over and stood behind her daughter It's true 
she said You would send me to school and expect me to grow up Peter accused 
Deny it but Mrs. Darling couldn't I knew it Peter cried Keep back madam No one 
is going to catch me and make me be a man I'm going back to Neverland but 
I'll miss you so much Wendy said I brought back the boys Perhaps that's enough 
Maybe I should go back with you Wendy turned to look at her mother Oh no 
Mrs. Darling said quickly but he needs a mother So do you sweetheart 
Mrs. Darling could see that her decision pained Wendy and Peter and so she 
agreed that Wendy could return to Neverland for one week a year to help Peter 
with the spring cleaning Peter was happy with this He had no sense of time 
anyway He bade Wendy good-bye and said that he would be back in the spring The 
boys went to school They learned many things but eventually they forgot how 
to fly They said it was because they were not practicing but in truth it 
seemed that they no longer believed and besides they no longer had fairy dust 
to help them Michael held on to his belief far longer than the others and 
Peter did come back as he'd promised at the first sign of spring Wendy had 
grown up since he'd seen her last and she was worried he would notice He 
didn't as usual he thought and talked mainly about himself She had been 
looking forward to reliving old adventures but Peter had had so many new ones 
since theirs he didn't even remember them Who is Captain Hook he asked You 
don't remember killing him and saving all of our lives I forget them when 
they are gone Peter replied The next spring Wendy waited but Peter never came 
Maybe he's sick Michael said Maybe we just imagined him Wendy cried at that 
Could it be but the following year Peter came as planned He didn't even seem 
to realize he had missed a year and that was the last time a girl named Wendy 
ever saw a boy named Peter Pan Years later when Wendy was married and living 
in the house she had grown up in and all of the lost boys were men she had a 
little girl named Jane who loved to ask questions about Peter Some days Wendy 
could barely remember him she had already forgotten many details and was glad 
to tell someone about him before she forgot him entirely I know all about him 
Mama Jane said Wendy looked up startled You do she asked I know him too Jane 
said Of course she did Wendy realized smiling sadly All children did One day 
Wendy was sitting on Jane's bed She had just finished putting Jane to sleep 
when Peter flew in through the open window and dropped onto the floor He was 
the same as ever Hello Wendy he said as though no time had passed Where are 
John and Michael He looked down at Jane Who's that asleep Peter Wendy said 
gently That's Jane my daughter You two have already met in her dreams if I'm 
not mistaken Peter wouldn't meet her eyes He didn't want to admit that Wendy 
was grown up I don't know what you're talking about he said firmly It's time 
for spring cleaning and you promised to come I can't Wendy said I don't 
remember how to fly I'll teach you again Peter seemed about to cry so Wendy 
stood up to hug him but when she did she loomed so tall above him obviously a 
grown-up that his eyes opened wide in alarm and he gasped It's true Peter she 
said I'm grown No You promised I couldn't help it she said I'm married now and 
a mother Peter started to cry so Wendy went downstairs to get him some warm 
milk While she was gone his sobs woke Jane She knew at once who the boy was By 
the time Wendy returned Peter was once again laughing and Jane was flying 
around the room with him giggling He needs a mother Mama Jane said I know 
Wendy said sadly Peter pulled Jane over to the window with him and she went 
willingly Oh no Wendy said moving between them just as her own mother once had 
Just for spring cleaning Jane begged Wendy shut her eyes All right she 
whispered and just as Jane would with her own daughter and Jane's daughter 
would with her own daughter after that Wendy watched her baby fly into the sky 
and off to Neverland until she was as small as the smallest star Then turning 
from the window she whispered Good night to Peter and to Jane and to you

your own first impressions and earliest memories of reading the classics do 
you remember wading through pages and pages of text to prepare for an exam or
