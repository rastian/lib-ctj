In the jungle
Poison frogs live in the rainforests of Central and South America They're often 
found in great numbers in some cases an entire species lives in an area no bigger
 than city blocks
Native Americans from Colombia South America have long used poison frogs for 
hunting They rub their blowgun darts on the backs of poison frogs to make poison 
darts Only a small amount of poison is needed to kill a large bird or monkey 
quickly That's how poison dart frogs got their name

poisonous frogs from the African country of Madagascar

Poison frogs don't need to blend into their surroundings their bright colors tell 
other animals to stay away 


Legs and toes
Poison frogs are tiny Some could even sit on your fingertip A poison frog's back 
legs are larger than its front legs This helps it jump quickly Unlike most frogs 
poison frogs don't have webbed feet
Webbed feet are perfect for swimming but most poison frogs live on land and not in 
water They have three or four toes on each foot Each toe has a sticky pad for 
gripping tree trunks and leaves

Piggyback rides
Some female poison frogs lay eggs on a leaf The male or female watches over the 
eggs When the eggs hatch the tadpoles climb onto the adult's back The adult carries 
the tadpoles to a tiny pool of water This is often the water that collects in the 
center of a plant called a bromeliad Some species lay eggs directly into water 
Parents often watch over and feed the tadpoles After the tadpoles grow into frogs
 they crawl out of the water

Deadly data
Bromeliads such as the pineapple have many leaves growing out of a common base in 
some bromeliads small pools of water form where the leaves come together

You are what you eat
Most poison frogs are active during the day They hunt for tiny bugs They mostly 
eat ants beetles and termites Poison frogs are very good at catching bugs with 
their long sticky tongues Many scientists think that the frogs' poison comes from 
the bugs they eat The bugs' poison comes out of the frogs' skin without hurting 
the frogs Poison frogs in captivity aren't poisonous That's because they aren't 
fed the same bugs they eat in the wild

Deadly data
Poison frogs live from to years in zoos No one knows how long they live in the 
wild

Deadly Toxins
A poison frog's poison is called a toxin Toxins are poisons made by living things 
the toxins come out of tiny holes in the frogs' skin this makes the frogs unsafe 
for animals to touch or eat
Many poison frog toxins are strong enough to stun or kill predators Three are even 
strong enough to kill people However not all poison frog toxins are deadly to all 
animals Some make the frogs' enemies sick Others just taste terrible

Deadly data
Only three species of poison frogs make toxins strong enough to kill people these 
are the frogs used to make poison darts

Even though the blue poison dart frog is toxic some snakes and spiders can eat it 
without getting hurt


Warning signs
Poison frogs are some of the most colorful animals in the world however those 
bright colors aren't just for looks they keep the frogs safe Predators see the 
colors and know to stay far away from these deadly little creatures the colors 
tell their enemies I'm no good to eat
Some nonpoisonous frogs mimic or copy the bright colors of poison frogs This is 
called mimicry Mimicry keeps nonpoisonous frogs safe by making predators think 
they're poisonous frogs
