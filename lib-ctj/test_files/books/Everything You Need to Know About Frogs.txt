Amphibians
Amphibians are animals that live partly in water and partly on land Frogs toads newts and 
salamanders are all amphibians Reptiles have dry scaly skin but amphibians have soft moist 
skin Most amphibians can breathe through their skin but only if it stays damp 
Adult amphibians can also breathe through lungs
How many there are about species of amphibian most of which are frogs 
There are about species of newt and salamander

Is a toad a frog
I have dry lumpy skin that looks like it's covered in warts 
People usually call me a toad but I'm really a frog

I'm a tree frog

most frogs live near a river or pools of water But in rainforests it is so humid the trees 
are wet all the time allowing some frogs to stay in them permanently They are called tree 
frogs and have huge sticky fingers to help them climb

Most baby amphibians live entirely in water Called tadpoles they swim like fish and breathe 
through gills As they grow up they develop legs and crawl onto land but they must always 
be in wet places

frog spawn tadpoles

Most amphibians breed in water Unlike reptiles which lay tough-shelled eggs on land most 
amphibians lay soft jellylike eggs in water

When a tadpole hatches out of an egg its first task in life is to eat what's left of its egg 
which is full of nutrients In most amphibians the tadpole changes into an adult by a process 
called metamorphosis

Reptiles Today there are more than reptile species on Earth the major groups are alligators 
and crocodiles turtles lizards and snakes All reptiles are cold-blooded which is why they warm 
themselves in the sun and have bodies covered in dry horny scales Some reptiles lay eggs 
others give birth to live young How Many

Lizards make up the largest group of reptiles with species followed by snakes species then 
turtles species There are fewer amphisbaenians  species and even fewer crocodilians species 

The smallest group is the tuataras with just species

Brightly colored iguanas and their relatives make up some of the most colorful lizards This 
green iguana is brightly colored with a few markings
All reptiles have backbones Legless and long Snakes are legless reptiles They're found all 
over the world but they don't do well in cold places The Common boa constrictor such as the 
one shown here can grow to ft Bright lines The red markings on a Madagascan giant day gecko 
vary between individuals Tuataras are a group of reptile found only in New Zealand

Light like sand Like many geckos this Sandstone gecko is colored to blend in with its 
surroundings Reptiles vary greatly in shape and size However all reptiles have scales in 
contrast to the smooth moist skin of amphibians Scales differ among species but they are a 
defining feature of a reptile

What's inside frogs have simple skeletons with fewer bones than other vertebrates animals with 
backbones They tend to have robust bodies and strong hind limbs most frogs have protruding 
eyes and no tail Take a look at what's under a frog's skin skull hand toe bone elongated ankle 
bone the hands and fingers of frogs vary according to lifestyle Climbing frogs need fingers 
that can grip well frogs tend to have broad heads with large sockets for the eyes 
They usually have short spines and no ribs a frog's brain is structured in a similar way to a 
human's brain The cerebellum region on the top of the brain controls posture and muscular 
coordination the legs and feet of frogs vary depending on where they live frogs that live in 
water have webbed toes the more time they spend in water the more webbed their toes area 
a frog's bone structure helps it jump a long way the tibia shin bone and fibula calf bone are 
fused into a single strong bone

Heart chambers
frogs have a developed nervous system that is made up of a brain nerves and a spinal cord a 
frog's heart has three chambers whereas a mammal's has four

Snakes have incredibly long necks the neck takes up one-third of their length their organs are 
also long and fit in one behind the other The heart is encased in a sac but it's not fixed 
in place preventing damage when swallowing a large animal

skull
trunk vertebra
ribs tail vertebra 

snakes have strong skulls with a solid and complete braincase

dry skin
snakes have dry smooth skin that is covered in scales they shed their skin regularly when 
they shed their skin it comes off as a whole layer and is often intact

longer species have as many as vertebra along their backbones smaller snakes have snakes 
have flexible spines and strong trunks that allow them to move in a wavelike pattern

snakes have really flexible lower and upper jaws allowing them to stretch their mouths 
open wide to eat prey that is often wider than their own heads

super skin frogs have very special skin they don't just wear it they also drink and breathe 
through it frogs don't usually swallow water like we do instead they absorb most of the 
moisture they need through their skin they also get water from prey that they eat their skin 
is used to get extra oxygen from the water in addition to the oxygen that's come into their 
lungs via their mouth cavity because frogs only get oxygen through their skin when it's moist 
they need to take good care of it or they might suffocate some frogs are slimy this is because 
their skin secretes a mucus that stops it from getting dry

Frogs regularly shed their outermost layer of skin cells to keep it healthy This looks 
pretty yucky they start to twist and turn and act like they have the hiccups 
they do this to stretch out of their old skin finally they pull the skin off over their head 
like a sweater and then this is gross they eat it 

Life cycle of a frog from a baby tadpole to a young frog

Life begins A male and a female frog come together to mate Eggs are laid in clumps or 
strings An egg hatches about six days after it's been fertilized At first it feeds on the 
remains of the yolk tiny tadpoles When an egg hatches a tadpole's mouth tail and external 
gills are not fully developed At about seven to days a tadpole begins to feed on algae and 
attaches itself to weeds Fully formed Between to weeks a frog has completed its growth cycle 
The timing varies between species and on the food and water supply A fully formed 
frog starts the process afresh by mating Getting bigger At four weeks the external gills are 
covered by body skin They eventually disappear and are replaced with lungs Tadpoles have tiny 
teeth that help them to chew away at plants and algae-covered surfaces
A bit of both
Tiny legs start to form from six to nine weeks The head becomes more obvious 
The arms begin to come out with the elbows showing first After nine weeks the tadpole is 
beginning to look more like a frog

Nearly there
By weeks the young froglet only has a small stub of a tail It looks like a smaller version of 
an adult frog Soon it will leave the water to live on the ground

Colors and markings amphibians and reptiles have a variety of markings and colors the 
spectrum ranges from bright reds and blues to muddy greens and browns 
some have spots while others have stripes Red-eyed tree frog Fire salamander 
Regal ring-neck snake

Texas coral snake Collared lizard Southern dwarf chameleon markings can be deceptive 
milk snakes have thin black bands and thick yellow and red bands they aren't poisonous 
but they appear to be dangerous because their banding is so similar to venomous coral 
snakes

hide and seek the Pacific tree frog is able to blend into its surroundings very easily it 
reacts to seasonal changes and can switch its coloring from brown to green It can also change 
its markings and the lightness of its skin according to the shift in background brightness 
colorful camouflage
the pattern and color of an amphibian or reptile can help it to blend in with its 
surroundings to hide from predators chameleons as their name suggests have an amazing 
ability to hide themselves by changing their appearance they can alter their color as well 
as their markings

strawberry poison-dart frogs are bright red this acts to warn other creatures 
that their skin secretions are highly toxic

Home sweet home

Amphibians are found on all continents except Antarctica Nearly all amphibians live in or near wet areas such as 
streams rivers ponds lakes and other wetlands but some display amazing adaptations that allow them to live in dry dusty 
deserts Many adult amphibians spend their lives on land but nearly all need to lay their eggs in water
Reptiles don't exist in Antarctica either Unlike amphibians they have watertight skin This means that they don't dry out as 
quickly Some reptiles live in hot dry places such as deserts Others live in warm swamps rivers or forests 
A few have even adapted to a life at sea but all return to land to lay their eggs

desert living the desert tortoise gopherus agassizii spends about percent of its life underground It can go a year without water
Couch's spadefoot toad scaphiopus couchii gets its name from its feet which help it to dig through loose sand it lives 
underground during dry months

The sandfish scincus scincus lives in Africa's Sahara desert and is famous for its ability to swim through sand
who lives in a dry place many reptiles live in deserts they can hide from the extreme temperatures in burrows the desert is 
the last place you might expect to find an amphibian but a few species have adapted to this extreme environment

plant life the female strawberry poison-dart frog oophaga pumilio lays her eggs on a leaf when the tadpoles hatch she moves 
them to a water-filled location

the gold frog brachycephalus didactylus  makes its home in mountain rainforests it mainly lives among leaf litter it is a 
ground-dweller since it can't jump or climb very well the female lays eggs that hatch directly into small frogs missing out 
the tadpole stage

who lives in a house
some frogs have adapted to live in dead leaves that have fallen onto the forest floor whereas others cleverly use leaves to 
hide their eggs until they hatch

up in the trees

the red-eyed tree frog agalychnis calidryas 
lives high up in rainforest canopies in Central America it is also known as the monkey frog because of its excellent climbing 
skillsthe tree hole frog metaphrynella sundana 
is a native of the lowland forests in Borneo it lives in the hollows of tree trunks the little frog uses tree hollows to 
amplify its mating calls so that it can be heard over long distances

Who lives up in the trees most of the world's frogs live in tropical rainforests where the temperature is nice and high and 
there is plenty of water all at sea

the yellow-bellied sea snake  pelamis platurus has the largest lung of any snake this helps it to control buoyancy
so it can stay under water for long periods of time up to three and a half hours

the hawksbill turtle eretmochelys imbricata 
uses its narrow beak to forage for mollusks sponges and other animals

Who's that in the sea

amphibians can't cope with seawater because their skin is too thin to protect them from all the salt reptiles have thicker 
skin and a few species can regulate the salt in their blood and are therefore able to live in the sea

in the wet

the African clawed frog xenopus laevis lives in ponds lakes or streams in southern Africa 
It spends most of its time in water

Northern water snake nerodia sipedon lives in and around streams ponds lakes and marshes water snakes are good swimmers 
they have been known to herd tadpoles to the water's edge before tucking in

who likes to live somewhere moist

amphibians provide tasty meals for many reptiles so where they live you will often find reptiles too the Northern water snake 
lives near ponds where it can catch amphibians cool creatures the wood frog survives freezing conditions by hibernating 
It finds cracks in rocks or gaps in logs or can bury itself in leaves to get through the cold winters
slow worm is a legless lizard that hibernates in piles of leaves or in hollows between tree roots it goes to sleep in October 
and emerges in March to breed in early summer
who's hiding from the cold
some reptiles and amphibians live in temperate parts of the world with cold winters one of the ways in which they can 
survive these cold months is to save energy by hibernating
rana sylvatica 
anguis fragilis


Amazon horned frog
famed for its big appetite and its bad temper the Amazon horned frog can grow to reach the size of a small dinner plate
enormous gape with a mouth that is wider than the length of its body the Amazon horned frog can gobble up prey almost as 
big as itself Patient predator Amazon horned frogs are voracious carnivores They ambush their prey by sitting quietly and 
waiting for it to approach before striking with a sudden snap of their jaws Amazon horned frogs aren't picky eaters Mostly 
they live on a diet of ants and other insects but they will try to eat any animal smaller than themselves including mice and 
occasionally rats They don't always get it right and may try to take on an animal that is too big for them to stomach
watch your feet the Amazon horned frog will sometimes defend itself by attacking people if it is disturbed they tend to grab 
anything that comes near them that could be edible impressive horns As its name suggests the Amazon horned frog has big fleshy 
horns above its eyes These are the largest horns of any of the horned frog species These pointed brows help to disguise the 
frog's shape as it sits among the leaves on the forest floor awaiting its prey frog facts Unlike other tadpoles the Amazon 
horned frog tadpoles are predatory from the start When they hatch they attack other tadpoles and even attack each other
Females lay up to eggs They lay their eggs around aquatic plants Males are slightly smaller than females They make a mating 
call that sounds like a cow lowing making a moo sound
this frogs grows up to in cm in length
How do crocodiles breathe underwater
Crocodiles have an amazing ability to breathe and hunt underwater at the same time by closing a flap of skin at the back of 
their throats they prevent water from flowing into their lungs they hold air in their lungs until they resurface they are able 
to keep their mouths open to grab prey underwater although they usually move to land to swallow it they also have flaps that 
can be closed over the nostril and ear openings

Florida softshell turtle apalone ferox
Saltwater crocodile crocodylus porosus

Okinawa frog rana Banded sea snake laticauda colubrine Turtles
Aquatic turtles breathe through their lungs the Florida softshell right has to surface and use its snout to fill its lungs 
with oxygen above water some turtles manage to stay underwater for weeks living on very low oxygen levels
Frogs Frogs can breathe through their skin when they're in the water their skin absorbs oxygen from the water around 
them find out more about their amazing skin on pages Sea snakes Sea snakes can stay underwater for up to five hours they 
have an enlarged lung that helps them to store lots of oxygen for when they're underwater they have to resurface to breathe in 
more oxygen before they can make another dive
Crocodilians have a flap of tissue behind the tongue that covers their throats when they are submerged in water
Crocodiles can waterproof their eyes with a membrane that acts as a transparent shield

Parental care Amphibians and reptiles have different ways of bringing their young into the world most hatch from an egg
Amphibian eggs A lot of amphibians lay their eggs in water where they develop into tiny tadpoles
However many amphibians choose a sheltered egg-laying location where they guard their eggs or protect them in a layer of foam
Other amphibians carry eggs on their backs in their vocal sacs in skin pockets or even in their stomachs
Most lizards lay eggs they rarely return to their nests although some skinks stay with their eggs to help maintain moisture 
and warmth Alligators and caimans make their nests from mounds of soil and leaves Crocodiles and gavels lay their eggs in 
holes they dig in sand or dry crumbly soil The shells of eggs laid by most turtles and tortoises are hard but the shells of 
marine and river turtle eggs are softer father figures in some species of frog the father plays a key role the male Darwin's 
frog takes care of the eggs as they develop when the tadpoles hatch he puts them in his vocal sac where they grow until they 
are released as tiny frogs
the male midwife toad right shows an interesting form of care the female lays the eggs but the male carries them on his legs 
after about three weeks the male takes the eggs to water where the tadpoles hatch absent parents the majority of geckos lay 
their eggs in bark or in the crevices of rocks geckos do not take care of their young the young are self-sufficient 
from birth turtles lay the most eggs out of all reptiles but they don't watch over them the eggs are left in soil or sand and 
when the baby turtles emerge they are on their own they have to learn survival skills pretty quickly when a caiman or 
alligator is born it stays close to its mother the young reptiles are protected by their mothers in the early weeks of their 
lives when danger is detected they can use their mother as a shield by hiding under her body Boy or girl the gender of baby 
crocodiles turtles and tortoises is often determined by egg temperature during incubation Actual size from this to this
the goliath frog starts out small its tadpole is the same size as that of the average frog but it keeps on growing until it 
reaches the size of a cat with legs outstretched the frog can measure almost ft in length goliath frog the goliath frog is the 
largest anuran the class of animals that includes frogs and toads the goliath frog lives in western Africa 
it is found across a narrow range of Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon in and around fast-flowing rivers and waterfalls it is a 
popular food for locals
how small the smallest frog in the world is the Monte Iberia frog of Cuba this tiny amphibian reaches a full size of only in 
mm from snout to vent it would sit comfortably on one of your fingernails smallest frog the Monte Iberia frog breeds by 
direct development missing out the tadpole stage altogether
conraua goliath
eleutherodactylus iberia



Sun Seekers reptiles are cold-blooded animals although once they have sunbathed their blood is about the same temperature as 
ours most reptiles live in warm climates as they rely on their surroundings to obtain heat reptiles keep their internal 
temperature at a constant level by moving to and from the shade a reptile can also obtain heat by resting its belly on a 
warm rock if the temperature doesn't suit a reptile then some species will hibernate until the temperature is right
in the summer months reptiles that live in tropical areas are inactive in the middle of the day since it's too hot to move
this graph shows the activity level of a lizard take a look at how and where it spends its day air temperature

reptiles need to stay warm when they eat a snake that has eaten a meal but cannot get to a warm place might die if the food in 
its stomach is too cold to digest can you spot the fake frogs use their markings for protection against predators one of the 
frogs shown here has a cleverly positioned eyespot that helps it to confuse any potential attackers can you tell which one it 
is Answer the fake eye is number which is actually the back of a dwarf frog here are the names of the other frogs 
Dumeril's bright-eyed frog Common big-headed frog Water-holding frog Poisonous tree frog Smoky jungle frog Mossy frog 
Dwarf frog Long-nosed horned frog Red-eyed tree frog Bronze frog American bullfrog Red-eyed tree frog

the glass frog with its amazing see-through body the glass frog blends in perfectly with its surroundings 
This little frog hangs on to leaves with tiny round-ended toes that seem almost to melt into the leaf surface it lives in 
Central and South America Most glass frogs live high in the rainforest canopy at such a height the trees are covered with 
clouds all year round and the frogs' skin is kept nice and moist they come down from the canopy to lay eggs
glass frogs are more transparent from beneath you can even see their hearts beating busily in their chests
glass frogs lay their eggs on leaves that overhang running water the male frog stands guard and protects the eggs from 
parasitic flies when the tadpoles hatch they drop down into the water they have powerful tails and are well-adapted for life 
in fast-flowing forest streams 

fancy feet geckos are the largest and most colorful family of lizards with known species their feet come in all shapes and 
sizes they can walk upside down on the ceiling some geckos have claws at the ends of their toes the claws are retractable 
they can be pulled back in on demand there are half a million hairs on a gecko toe there is only one known surface a gecko 
can't stick to that's the shiny black plastic used to coat nonstick pans if an average-sized adult gecko had every hair on 
its feet in contact with a surface it would have enough force to lift a lb kg weight the special pads on a gecko's feet are 
self-cleaning dust or dirt in the hairs might stop them gripping fortunately dirt easily drops off a gecko's scaly skin


the water-holding frog where does it live The water-holding frog lives in Australia During the rainy season the frog absorbs 
water and in doing so puts on percent of its own body weight to keep from losing this water during the dry months it creates 
an underground home to stay in since the mud is still wet from the rainy season its easy to burrow down more than ft 
beneath the surface it enters a summer hibernation and can stay underground waiting for the next rainy season when it senses 
the water from heavy rains it wakes up and starts to resurface 
storing waterthe water-holding frog stores water in its bladder 
and beneath its skin living well aborigines used to dig up the frog to extract drinking water they used the frogs as a 
living well to gain access to the water they squeezed the frog
feeding time when active above the ground it lives in water bodies its feeds on other frogs tadpoles and small insects
egg laying a female usually lays more than eggs at one time she lays her eggs and then goes into hibernation she enters this 
state in order to prevent damage from extreme dryness and heat in cm this frog is bloated with all the water it has consumed
beforein its normal state a water holding frog is just in cm in length after when it has consumed half its own body weight in 
water its body is enlarged to in. cm in length widespread in Australia When active it lives in puddles pools and streams

The term for a water-holding frog's sleep is estivation it usually happens in the summer 

top deadliest most reptiles and amphibians are perfectly harmless to people but a few can inflict lethal bites or 
kill with a 
touch of their poisonous skin Here are some of the world's deadliest cold-blooded killers deadliest amphibian deadliest 
lizard
Poison dart frog of Colombia can kill you if you touch it just one of these tiny frogs contains enough poison to paralyze and 
kill people the deadly chemical in the frog's skin comes from poisonous plants which are eaten by ants that are in turn eaten 
by the frog native peoples use the frog to make poison blowpipe darts Australian brown snake the eastern or common brown 
snake of Australia is the world's second most venomous land snake after the Taipan based on the strength of its venom its bite 
is usually fatal unless the victim receives an antidote the venom contains potent nerve toxins which paralyze the victim's 
muscles and chemicals that make the blood clot Inland taipan the inland taipan of Australia has the deadliest venom of any 
land-dwelling snake the venom injected by a bite not only poisons nerves but also causes the victim's blood to clot blocking 
arteries before an antidote was developed there were no known survivors of a taipan bite Fortunately the taipan is very shy and 
bites are rare saltwater crocodile the saltwater crocodile of Australia and parts of Asia is the largest reptile on Earth with 
big males weighing more than a ton normally seen basking lazily in the sun or wallowing in shallow water it is capable of 
explosive bursts of speed when attacking it drags its victim into the water and then rolls around to tear the body apart
komodo dragon the world's largest lizard the Komodo dragon weighs as much as a man and can attack and devour a human being The 
lizard kills pray in an especially gruesome way biting victims with filthy teeth that are covered with disease-causing 
bacteria the victim may escape but the bite turns into a festering wound that can kill Nile crocodile the Nile crocodile of 
Africa kills a large number of people since locals often collect water or wash from the river it sneaks toward victims with its 
body hidden in the muddy water and only its eyes above the surface it then leaps out and snatches the victim in its jaws 
before dragging them in the water Eastern diamond back rattlesnake the bite of North America's deadliest snake can kill in a 
matter of hours the Eastern diamondback rattlesnake venom contains hemotoxins which attack the blood and damage a huge area of 
tissue potentially leading to loss of a limb or death thanks to rapid treatment with antivenom only a handful of deaths occur 
each year Puff adder this bad-tempered African snake is called the puff adder because it hisses and puffs when approached 
while curling itself into a tight shape ready to strike get too close and it will lunge forward and sink its long fangs deep 
into your skin injecting a venom that attacks the blood the puff adder causes more deaths than any other snake in Africa
Fer-de-Lance this South American relative of the rattlesnake preys on rats and other rodents killing them by injecting venom 
through its hollow teeth the fer-de-lance's venom is packed with enzymes that destroy blood cells and body tissues causing 
fits of vomiting diarrhea paralysis and blackouts Black mamba the bite of a black mamba kills in less than an hour and without 
antivenom is almost always fatal the lethal ingredient in the venom is dendrotoxin a chemical that paralyzes muscles and stops 
the lungs and heart from working death is usually cause by suffocation

sixth sense bamboo pit viper
royal python the heat pit in a python has one section in a pit viper it has two sections the inner one is the temperature of 
the snake and the outer one heats up when the snake is near a heat source snakes such as pythons pit vipers and some boas are 
able to pick up small changes in air temperature around them by using organs on their faces called heat pits they detect these 
changes as infrared rays heat vision this sixth sense allows them to locate prey during the night this royal python sees a 
thermal image in its brain that allows it to track prey quickly and efficiently This system is so precise that pit vipers can 
notice changes in temperature that are less than a degree the five senses hearing snakes do not have external ears their 
hearing is poor so they rely on vibrations from the ground that pass through skull bones on their lower jaws to their ears this 
puff adder is sticking close to the ground to sense any vibrations sight snakes generally don't have great vision although 
they are adept to detecting movement the vine snake is unusual in that it has forward-facing eyes that give it binocular 
vision and a good sense of distance taste the Jacobson's organ enables snakes to taste and smell the organ consists of two 
sensitive cavities in the roof of the snake's mouth their tongue gathers particles that the organ analyzes snakes that live in 
water such as the green anaconda are able to use their tongue to gather particles underwater smell snakes use their sense of 
smell to help them locate prey the common boa constrictor boa constrictor detects its prey through scent and taste using its 
Jacobson's organ it is able to work out if prey is nearby boas wrap their coils around their victims and squeeze hard to kill 
them touch from the beginning of a snake's life it relies on touch for guidance it uses its tongue and pressure receptors in 
its skin to touch objects move and orientate itself the Indian python is using its tongue to explore its surroundings

gecko feet nothing goes like a gecko's toes they even inspire science Geckos are small lizards but they've set humans a big 
challenge to mimic their amazing ability to walk up walls their secret billions of tiny hairs called setae and long toes to 
help a lizard grasp the bumps There are hairs in of a gecko's foot each hair has between and filaments that grip onto the wall 
as it climbs there's more to a gecko's feet than hair their toes bend backward compared to ours and they must peel them off a 
surface a bit at a time it's like Velcro it won't slip the toe-pads on fan-fingered geckos are split into two parts this gives 
them extra grip even compared with other geckos Stickybot's feet have rows of stiff yet flexible gecko tape on them this 
material produces a sticky force that allows the robot to climb up windows and whiteboards stickybot uses motors to mimic one 
animal stickybot is a robot that can climb smooth surfaces such as glass how

when science copies nature it's called biomimetics

the newt that never grows up the captive-bred axolotl looks like an albino with no pigment in its skin but since it has 
pigment in its eyes it's called leucistic which means reduced pigment  wild-type axolotls are usually dark wild axolotls are 
only found in the canal systems of Mexico's Lake Xochimilco located close to Mexico City these canals are threatened by 
pollution and increased development  axolotl means water-dog in the ancient language of the Aztecs  
The axolotl is the Peter Pan of the animal world It doesn't undergo metamorphosis like many other amphibians instead it spends 
its entire life in a juvenile form keeping it gills and fins and living in the water the axolotl grows steadily bigger until 
it is old enough to reproduce though their numbers are falling in the wild many axolotls are kept in captivity Axolotls are 
popular pets but they are also studied by scientists because of their interesting life cycles and their powers of regeneration 
axolotls can regrow entire limbs in captivity it is sometimes possible to make the axolotls metamorphose by injecting them with 
special hormones that trigger growth and development in their adult form they look like their near-relatives the tiger 
salamanders 

what's for dinner lizards for starters most lizards are insect-eaters insectivores but some have special diets Some big lizards 
are carnivores and eat animals such as birds rodents or other lizards A few lizards are plant-eaters herbivores the 
binge-eater the Gila monster only eats between times a year but when it does this lizard can consume the equivalent of over 
half of its body weight It mainly eats the eggs of birds or other reptiles the Gila monster stores fat in its thick stumpy 
tail it is this energy store that allows it to survive for months without food The insectivore The Sinai agama is a slender 
lizard it has long thin limbs which make it good at running over the hot sand when it hunts in the heat of the day It feeds on 
ants and other insects but it also eats sand The vegetarian One plant-eating lizard is the green iguana iguana iguana which 
survives on a complex diet of leaves shoots flowers and fruit It can't digest animal protein well although it may sometimes 
accidentally eat small insects and other invertebrates that are attached to vegetation Frog food that moves
Most frogs are carnivorous Nearly all of them eat insects and other invertebrates like worms spiders and centipedes but 
some of the bigger frogs take on larger prey such as mice birds or other frogs The cannibal The American bullfrog is the 
largest of the North American frogs growing up to in. cm in length These frogs are voracious eaters and will eat anything they 
can fit into their exceedingly large mouths This includes insects and other invertebrates rodents birds snakes and even other 
bullfrogs The jelly-eater Leatherback turtles are the biggest turtles in the world They live on a diet of jellyfish and comb 
jellies both of which are made up mostly of water To get enough nutrients to grow so big leatherbacks eat huge quantities of 
food they sometimes eat their own weight in jellyfish each day Sea turtles The diet of sea turtles varies between species Some 
eat a wide range of foods both plant and animal but others have special diets with adaptations that make it easier to eat 
particular things The cruncher Loggerhead turtles mainly eat hard-shelled creatures such as crabs conchs and clams Their big 
heads and strong jaws help them to crush the shells and they can hold their breath for up to minutes on their dives down to 
the sea floor The fruitivore Izecksohn's Brazilian tree frog is one of the very few plant-eating herbivorous frogs Living in 
bromeliads in the Brazilian coastal moist forest it eats brightly colored berries from arum plants and fruit from the cocoa 
tree The frog helps to disperse plant seeds into its poop The sponge muncher Hawksbill turtles live around coral reefs rich in 
marine life They can eat a range of prey but they mainly live on a diet of primitive plantlike animals called sponges The 
turtles are named after their sharp birdlike beaks that make it easier for them to reach sponges growing in crevices between 
rocks and corals The eater Poison dart frogs use poisons in their skin to deter potential predators They get their poisons 
from their food The strawberry poison-dart frog gets its toxins from a mite that lives in the soil in Central and South 
America The frog also eats other small invertebrates As the frog eats its food the toxic chemicals build up in its body which 
makes it more poisonous

living fossils The giant salamanders of China and Japan are the world's largest amphibians While most salamanders would fit in 
the palm of your hand giant salamanders grow bigger than your arm and some longer than the length of your entire body No one 
knows how long giant salamanders live in the wild but the oldest captive salamander lived for years 

Giant salamanders have 
changed very little in the last million years which is why they are described as living fossils 

Chinese giant salamander Giant 
salamanders are paler on their undersides The Chinese giant salamander is the world's largest amphibian growing up to ft in 
length in captivity It is heavily built with a flat head and wide mouth Like its Japanese cousin it lives a completely 
aquatic 
existence and its short legs cannot support its body weight when it is out of the water 
Skeleton of a Chinese giant salamander 
Stressed-out salamanders can produce a thick smelly mucous that makes them very unpleasant to handle What a stink 
Giant salamanders live in hollows in the banks of streams and rivers At night they walk slowly along the bottom feeding on 
fish and crustaceans They have a powerful bite and they catch their food with a quick sideways snap of their wide many-toothed 
mouths The Japanese salamander is the second-largest amphibian growing up to ft in length The Japanese and Chinese salamanders 
breathe through their skin Their skin has folds and wrinkles that increase the surface area allowing more oxygen in They like 
to live in clean fast-flowing streams but numbers of both species have dropped owing to pollution and dam building Japanese

Snakes and ladders 


Are you feeling lucky Challenge a friend to a game of snakes and ladders and see who gets to the top first.
Be careful not to step on a snake the ones in this game all have deadly bites You will need One or more friends to play with
A small object to use as a counter for each person A die How to play To decide who starts everyone rolls the die and the person 
with the highest number goes first When it's your turn roll the die and move your counter along by the number If you land on 
the bottom of a ladder climb to the top of the ladder If you land on the top of a snake slither down the square at its bottom 
If you roll a six take another turn The first person to pass wins Good luck

horned lizard Built like miniature armored 
tanks horned lizards move ponderously along the baking ground of their dry desert habitats stopping to sunbathe dig burrows 
and 
snack on ants They have evolved a range of adaptations to help them survive Found in northern Mexico and southwestern in cm
Bloody defense Horned lizards use the spines on their backs in self-defense In addition they also exhibit a startling form of 
defense A network of weakened blood vessels allow them to spray a stream of blood out from their eyes toward attackers This 
blood tastes horrible to potential predators Dew drink Living in dry desert conditions horned lizards have evolved to get as 
much water from their environment as possible The tiny grooves between the lizard's scales channel moisture from dew that has 
gathered on its body toward the lizard's mouth providing a refreshing morning drink Body beautiful
Another adaptation to its desert environment is the horned lizard's wide flat body This allows it to catch rainwater during 
infrequent desert showers The lizard raises its tail and channels droplets down to its mouth Its bumpy mottled appearance 
helps it blend into its surroundings and avoid detection by predators flying above Sticky tongues This ant contains lost of 
chitin which is indigestible to a horned lizard That means the lizard must eat an awful lot of ants to get enough nutrients to 
survive Thankfully the lizard has a secret weapon a long sticky tongue which it flicks out like a whip to gather lots of ants 
Horny heads The lizards are named for their distinctive horns These shapes break up the outline of the lizards' heads making 
them harder to spot in among the rocks and stones of the desert Their raised brow bumps help to shield their eyes from the 
strong desert sun while thick eyelids protect their eyes from stings of their ant prey

why did this woman turn people into stone The Medusa Myth When she angered the gods Medusa was turned into a snake-headed 
monster Perseus holding the head of MedusaIn Greek Mythology Medusa was a fearsome snake-headed monster Once a beautiful woman 
she was transformed by the goddess Athena as punishment for meeting the sea god Poseidon in Athena's temple In some tales not 
only was her hair turned into a twisting mass of hissing snakes but her teeth also became tusks and her skin was made green and 
scaly Anyone who looked at her hideous form turned into stone Medusa was eventually slain by Perseus the mortal 
son of Zeus king of the gods He did not look at Medusa directly but watched her reflection in his metal shield before 
beheading her Even after she was slain the head of Medusa still had the power to turn anyone who looked at it into stone 
Perseus returned it to the goddess Athena who attached it to her shield and used it to scare her enemies

in search of flapping frog the Lake Titicaca frog is the largest aquatic frog in the world The lake it lives in is feet 
above sea level making it a very cold environment to reside in Why does this frog exercise
it's chilly The air is thin and freezing cold so the Lake Titicaca frog survives by living permanently at the lake's bottom 
The water here never rises above The frog doesn't usually need to surface for air since it absorbs oxygen through its skin It 
has a lot of skin with plenty of flaps and a big surface area enabling it to breathe underwater The Lake Titicaca frog can 
measure up to in cm long and weigh up to lb kg It does push-ups in order to circulate the water surrounding its body This 
keeps its skin folds in contact with oxygenated water Lake Titicaca is located on the border of Bolivia and Peru
The Lake Titicaca frog breeds in shallow waters where it lays about eggs defense techniques reptiles and amphibians use a 
variety of ways to defend themselves against their enemies They spit rattle trick and scare their way to safety

Fearsome frills The frilled lizard has a loose ruff of skin around its neck Most of the time it sits flat like a cape around 
the lizard's shoulders but when the lizard is threatened the ruff expands and the lizard lunges forward attempting to startle 
its attacker for just long enough to make its escape Tail trickery Some lizards have developed a startling form of defense 
dropping their tails and leaving them wriggling on the ground to distract predators Skinks geckos and slow worms can all 
detach their tails Some can grow new tails but these are never as long as the original Clever disguise The best way to keep 
from being eaten is not to be noticed The pygmy leaf-dropping frog has a very unglamorous way to merge in with its surroundings 
by looking like a bird dropping It sits on leaves in full view and tries to escape attention by sitting very still
Playing dead Many predators do not eat animals that are already dead so pretending to be dead can be an excellent way to stay 
alive Some snakes have very dramatic mock deaths where they writhe erratically bite themselves and fall back to lie still 
Sometimes blood trickles from their open mouths Toxic to the touch Some frogs protect themselves by making themselves 
poisonous to the touch When this marbled milk frog feels threatened the poison glands that line its back and neck start to 
release a toxic milky secretion Warning rattle The rattlesnake warns off predators by making an intimidating rattling sound 
with its tail Its rattle is made of hollow sections that clash against each other when the snake shakes its tail 
Spitting venom
Some cobras spray or spit venom at a threat. the Mozambique spitting cobra can target its venom with pinpoint accuracy This 
spitting behavior is so instinctive that young snakes will spit even as they are hatching from their eggs
Big and scary To convince a predator that it is too big to handle the black rain frog puffs itself up to twice its original 
size This sudden growth spurt also makes it harder to dig the frog out from its tunnel

travel blog leatherback sea turtle search the leatherback sea turtle loves to travel and swims from warm tropical seas to 
cold temperate waters Once a sea turtle hatchling makes it past any beach predators and into the ocean it sets out on a 
swimming frenzy It will keep paddling for up to hours

Sea turtle species Hawksbill Green Loggerhead Olive Ridley Kemp's Ridley Flatback

Travel facts Leatherback sea turtles are big travelers One leatherback was tracked over an epic voyage of more than miles km 
Leatherbacks travel these long distances to feed their appetite for jellyfish

User Profile Leatherback sea turtle Size ft Leatherbacks are the largest species of sea turtle and one of the largest reptiles 
on Earth An adult leatherback can weight more than lb kg Size ft Departure time Adult sea turtles spend their lives in the 
world's oceans They roam large distances in search of food and mates Adult females also make long excursions to breeding 
beaches usually where they were born to lay their eggs Experts are still researching how sea turtles find their way back but 
they believe sea turtles use Earth's magnetic field the sea's chemistry and their memories A built-in swimsuit
The leatherback's shell known as a carapace is made of a tough leathery cartilage material which gives the sea turtle its 
Latin name Life's a beach Once the female leatherback has found a beach she digs a small hole in the sand using her back 
flippers She then lays about eggs and covers them with sand Sea turtles usually nest at night when it is safer A new journey
The eggs take about two months to incubate in the sand The baby sea turtles known as hatchlings can take days to dig their way 
out Hatchlings normally emerge at night and make the long journey across the beach to the lapping waves This is a dangerous 
time for a hatchling because they are vulnerable to predators such as birds and crabs About percent of hatchlings never make 
it to adulthood Where to go The hatchlings use their flippers to travel to the sea Experts believe they know the right way to 
go because of the light reflected from the water even at night and the slope of the beach 

lost found 

certain amphibians and reptiles are declining in numbers or being lost altogether However lots of new species are being found 
every year Although they can't replace the lost animals that become extinct they can give scientists hopes for the future

Wanted The southern gastric-brooding frog has not been seen in the wild since After mating the female swallowed her eggs 
switching off her digestive system to allow the larvae to develop After weeks the female regurgitated her young

Wanted The golden toad fell prey to climate change with rising temperatures and erratic rainfall Fewer breeding pools meant 
that frogs gathered in greater numbers and this allowed disease to pass quickly through the population Wanted
The Darwin's frog has an unusual snout The male uses his vocal sac to hold the tadpoles until they turn into young frogs 
Numbers are declining because the frog's habitat is being destroyed through drought and deforestation 

Wanted Last seen in the Hula painted frog was once found along the eastern shore of Israel's Lake Hula When the Hula marshes 
were drained in an attempt to reduce the incidence of malaria and make way for agricultural land it also wiped out the species
Found In a survey found that possible new species of frog were living on the island of Madagascar Statistics like these are 
exciting since they give scientists promise of finding new populations of other animals Earth contains so many surprises 
scientists have to be willing to explore remote places to find and identify new species although every now and then they'll 
find them in places that have already been explored Occasionally species new to scientists have been known to locals for years 
The bitatawa monitor lizard was found by scientists who were walking across a field in the Philippines in However the locals 
had been hunting it for a long time Scientists missed it because it doesn't come down from the trees very often
Discovered in Indonesia's Foja Mountains during an expedition in this little frog has a long Pinocchio-like inflatable nose 
that expands when the male is calling out He was seen sitting on a bag of rice in the scientist's campsite and is thought to be 
one of about species of Australasian tree frogs

is it a bird is it a plane The Wallace's flying frog is also known as the parachute frog and is on of the few aerial 
amphibians The membranes between its toes and the loose skin on its sides help it to glide through the air although it doesn't 
actually fly Found in Malaysia and Borneoin cm in cm Southeast Asia I am a Kuhl's flying gecko and I love jumping from trees 
My strong webbed feet help me glide through the air The flaps of skin along my flanks and my flattened frilly tail also help 
to control my descent Kuhl's flying gecko is a reptile that lives in tropical forests It's one of the several lizards that fly 
through the forest and jump from trees when escaping danger When I'm resting on a tree I often face head-down This allows me 
to take off quickly if I need to I'm always ready to jump and glide I'm a nocturnal creature so I remain still during the day 
I rely on my brown skin with barkline markings to allow me to blend in with the trees My ability to camouflage myself means I 
can remain undetected 

don't look up  The paradise tree snake is capable of gliding among high trees in tropical forests it dangles from the end of a 
branch and decides on its direction of travel it then pushes its body away from the tree pulls in its stomach and flares out 
its ribs so that it is twice as flat as normal it glides through the air in a motion of lateral undulation Wave like movements 
that propel it forward in line with the ground so that it can land safely it can glide distances up to ft 
It's considered to be the most adept of the flying snakes Watch out for the snake it's flying 
The paradise tree snake has a slender body and a long tail It can measure up to ft It's a daytime hunter and lives on a diet 
of lizards frogs bats and birds Its toxicity is not dangerous to humans

how did frogs' legs shock science In a chance discovery on professor Luigi Galvani's experiment table led eventually to the 
invention of the first battery without which our lives today would be very different So how did one small hop for an 
amphibian become a giant leap for science In further experiments Galvani made the legs hop right across the table
Luigi Galvani was a biologist at the University of Bologna Italy He was experimenting with frogs' legs and static electricity 
when his metal scalpel touched the brass hook that held the legs Suddenly the legs twitched Volta termed Galvani's 
discovery Galvanism Today this area of science is electrophysiology

Luigi Galvani A shocking discovery Just after Galvani's accidental discovery it happened again in a separate experiment 
Galvani's assistant touched the frog's sciatic spinal cord nerve with his scalpel while he was taking a spark of static 
electricity from a storage jar Galvani wrote suddenly all the muscles of its limbs were seen to be so contracted that they 
seemed to have fallen into tonic convulsions

Jumping to conclusions Galvani realized that electricity had made the legs twitch but where did it come from He mistakenly 
concluded that the frog's bodily fluids must have been a source of electricity which he called animal electricity
Science owes a lot to Galvani including the study of bioelectricity electricity in a body's nervous system and the process of 
galvanizing or coating metal to protect it.

One thing leads to another Galvani published his ideas in when scientist Count Alessandro Volta read them Convinced that 
Galvani was wrong Volta repeated the experiments and found that electricity did not come from the frog but that wet tissue in 
the legs allowed electricity to flow between the metal instruments holding up the legs This gave Volta an idea a pile of 
copper and zinc disks with layers of wet cardboard between them would not only conduct electricity but could also store it 
This Voltaic pile was the first battery how to survive an encounter with a crocodile or an alligator The jaws of crocodilians 
are so strong they can crush bones when they close Do research and keep an eye out Swim in designated areas only Alligators 
and crocodiles tend to hunt at dusk or at night so don't go swimming at those times Crocodilians often only show their eyes 
and nostrils above the water so you probably won't spot them easily Give them space You should not get too close to crocodiles 
and alligators ft is usually enough room to keep between you and them Catch me if you can The average adult can outrun a 
crocodile or alligator on land The fastest land speed for a crocodilian is only mph kph Don't scare them

Steer clear of the riverbank if you're on a boat coming around a bend Crocodilians like to bask on the banks and will react in 
self-defense if you scare them If you spot a crocodile or alligator try to let them know you're there by slapping the water 
with your oars or by blowing a whistle Get help as soon as you can If a crocodilian is defending its young or its territory it 
might bite its opponent quickly and then let go However it is more likely to bite its prey and not release it If you manage to 
get away from its grip then you should seek medical help immediately working with amphibians and reptiles
You want to be what A herpetologist Zoology is the name given to the study of animals Herpetology is a branch of zoology and 
is the study of reptiles and amphibians A herpetologist is an expert on these animals Animal keeper Animal keepers are 
responsible for looking after animals in zoos and wildlife parks The amphibian and reptile keepers must be expert 
herpetologists They need to know about how these animals live in the wild what they eat how much exercise they need and what 
temperature and light conditions they need to live Exotic animal breeder Reptiles and amphibians are fascinating animals and 
many people like keeping them as pets Taking animals from the wild can be bad for wild populations so specialized breeders 
supply the pet trade by rearing animals like frogs snakes and lizards in captivity Photographer Successful animal 
photographers get to travel the world and have to know an awful lot about their subject to track it down and get the perfect 
photo It's also not always a comfortable job carrying heavy equipment in difficult terrain and camping in remote locations are 
all part of the challenge Veterinary surgeon Some vets are specially trained to deal with animals such as reptiles and 
amphibians They know lots about the health and lifestyles of these creatures and how to care for them in the wild or in 
captivity Working with large reptiles can be a hazardous profession since a bite from an alligator is more serious than one 
from a dogSnake handler If you've got a snake problem who are you going to call Professional or volunteer snake handlers can 
be called in to remove snakes from houses and other places where they can come in contact with people These may be escaped 
pets or wild snakes living where they shouldn't be looking for shade in the summer months Biomedical researcher 
Some species of amphibian and reptile produce toxins and poisons Biomedical researchers study these chemicals and look at ways 
in which they can be of use to humans More than chemicals produced by amphibians and reptiles have been found to be of use in 
human medicines how does this lizard walk on water The green basilisk lizard is often referred to as the Jesus Christ lizard 
because it appears to walk on water How it actually manages this miracle is by running short distances using its hindlegs 
Its toes have fringes of skin that open out to create more surface area These curious and strange-looking lizards gain their 
name from Greek mythology Made up of parts of a snake rooster and lion the basilisk was able to kill a man just from one look 
The name basilisk means little king in Greek which seems appropriate considering the crests on its head back and tail

The Mozambique cobra can spray its venom over distances of ft Biggest clutch of eggs Hawksbill turtles can lay over eggs in a 
single clutch During the turtles' breeding season which runs from July to October female turtles may create nests each with a 
separate clutch of eggs Strangest life cycle One contender for this title has to be Labordi's chameleon This reptile spends 
most of its life up to month as an egg weathering the desert droughts it lives for only a few months after hatching
The loudest The couqui frog is a small Puerto Rican tree frog measuring just in cm in length For something so small it is 
incredibly loud and its distinctive call has been measured at over decibels The most teeth American alligators have between 
and teeth The teeth are long and pointed but gradually wear down to be replaced by new teeth An alligator can go through to 
teeth during its lifetime The oldest The oldest vertebrate animal with a backbone is thought to be a Seychelles giant tortoise 
nicknamed Johnathan Historians believe that he is now at least years old Best sense of smell Komodo dragons will readily feed 
on rotting meat They smell with chemical detectors on their tongues and can sense dead animals up to miles km away Komodo 
dragons are the world's largest lizard Biggest leaps Most frogs can leap over distances of time their own body length and some 
species can jump up to times their body length The largest frog in the world the Goliath frog can jump almost ft cm 

Longest tongue Chameleons can have tongues that are as long or even longer than their bodies it takes them less than a 
second to shoot their tongues out and the sticky saliva on the tongue's club like tip traps its insect preyMost difficult to 
eatOne contender for this title must be the armadillo girdled lizard This lizard is covered in thick and spiked armor like 
scales it can roll up into a ball making itself even more unappealing to potential predators Largest reptile

The saltwater crocodile is the world's largest reptile growing to more than ft in length Not only the largest but also 
the heaviest saltwater crocodiles can weigh over a ton Most poisonous snake Sea snakes are the most poisonous snakes in the
