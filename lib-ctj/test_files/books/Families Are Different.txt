Families Are Different

Hello my name is Nico Actually Nicola but everyone calls me Nico I live in a large town with my family I have a mother and father a big sister and a dog My sister's name is Angelica We call her Angel but if you ask me she's no angel Sometimes she drives me We fight a lot but we still love each other tons Angel is teaching me how to read but I don't always pay attention Angel looks a lot like me We are both adopted We came from Korea when we were babies Korea is a country on the other side of the world  Sometimes we wear our special Korean outfits First came Angel Then four years later I came My mom and dad and sister met me at the airport but not my dog My dog's name is Buster He doesn't look like me but sometimes we have the same hairdo He gives me lots of kisses Buster is one of my best friends I have four best friends counting Angel and Buster My other best friends are Molly and Anna We go to kindergarten together where we play for most of the day We are six years old now My mom and dad are really old You have to count to above thirty to get to their age I love them a lot I hug hug hug them and give them lots of kisses They don't look like me either They both have blue eyes and wavy hair That's because I'm adopted I grew in someone else's belly but my mom and dad are the ones who promised to love and take care of me forever At first I didn't think it was strange that I looked different Then for a while it bothered me because Molly and Anna look like their moms and dads I wanted to be just like them Sometimes I even felt angry or sad I would hear mothers talking to each other and they would say your baby looks just like you That made me feel different too Then I talked to my mom about it She told me that there are different kinds of families She said that they are glued together with a special kind of glue called love So I started looking around and this is what I saw One of the kids in my class looks like his dad but not like his mom One boy has a sister and a mom for a family but not a dad There is a big family who are all related They look alike even their dog Sparky And there is also a medium sized family who all look different even though they're related too There is a very small family of a little girl and her dad And there's a girl whose parents are divorced There is a boy who lives with his sister and his grandmother and grandfather My sister has a friend who lives with her father her stepmother and her younger half sister And there is even a family that has one kid who grew in his mom's belly and one kid who was adopted There sure are a lot of different families Now I don't think I'm strange at all I'm just like everyone else I'm different And boy boy my family must be stuck together with strong glue because There's sure a ton of love around here
