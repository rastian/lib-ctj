forest bright forest night


Sun light forest bright After sleeping through the night 
Leap and flash deer splash Climb and stumble bear cubs tumble 
Whittle and rap woodpeckers tap Slither and slip snakes whip 
Jabber and talk blue jays squawk 
Store and stash squirrels dash 
Chatter and chase chipmunks race 
Strut and wobble turkeys gobble 
Buzz and dip bees sip 
Roost and nest quail rest 
Sun sinks Moon winks Hello forest night 


Many forest animals are awake during the day 
They sleep at night as we do 
Many other forest animals are awake at night 
When do they sleep They sleep during the day 
By day While a deer leaps through the forest an owl sleeps in a tree 
While bears climb and tumble porcupines sleep in a tree or burrow 
While woodpeckers rap and tap opossums sleep in a tree hollow 
While snakes slither foxes sleep in an underground den 
While blue jays jabber skunks sleep in a den under rocks or logs 
While squirrels dash salamanders sleep underground or under plants 
While chipmunks chase mice sleep in an underground burrow 
While turkeys gobble beavers sleep in a lodge made of sticks 
While bees buzz crickets sleep 
While quail roost frogs sleep under plants or in a burrow Flip The Book For Forest Night 

Many forest animals are awake during the night 
they sleep during the day 
Many other forest animals are awake during the day 
They sleep at night 
At night 
While an owl is awake and hooting a deer sleeps in a thicket 
While porcupines plod around the forest bears sleep in a den 
While opossums climb woodpeckers sleep in a tree hollow 
While foxes prowl snakes sleep under a rock log or in a burrow 
While skunks scurry blue jays sleep in a tree nest 
While salamanders hide squirrels sleep in a nest of leaves up in a tree 
While mice munch chipmunks sleep in an underground burrow 
While beavers swim turkeys sleep in a tree 
While crickets call bees sleep in a hive 
While frogs hop quail sleep in a nest on the ground
