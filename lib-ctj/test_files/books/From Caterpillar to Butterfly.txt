from caterpillar to butterfly


Room  
Today a caterpillar came to school in a jar It is eating green leaves It is 
climbing and wiggling This tiny caterpillar is going to change It will change into
 a beautiful butterfly 

Caterpillars usually turn into butterflies outdoors They 
live in gardens and meadows and yards but we will watch our caterpillar change 
into a butterfly right here in our classroom This change is called metamorphosis




Our caterpillar started out as a tiny egg The mother butterfly laid the egg on a 
leaf

 A butterfly is an insect

The egg is tiny

It is the size of a pinhead



When the 
caterpillar hatched out of the egg it was hungry It ate its way out of its own 
eggshell Then it started to eat green plants right away



The mother butterfly lays
 her eggs on plants that the caterpillar will eat

These are called host plants

The
 caterpillar is also called the larva


A caterpillar's job is to eat and eat and eat
 so it will grow and grow and grow



Each day when we come into school we look at 
our caterpillar Each day it is bigger



Is it bigger

The caterpillar eats and grows 
for 12 to 14 days



Our skin grows with us but a caterpillar's skin does not grow. 
When the caterpillar gets too big for its skin the skin splits down the back


The 
caterpillar crawls right out of its own skin. It has new skin underneath This is 
called molting Our caterpillar will molt four or five times



After many days our 
caterpillar is finished growing. It is much bigger than when it first came to 
school It is almost as big as my little finger now 



Button of silk


Chrysalis


The 
chrysalis is also called the pupa


Our caterpillar is making a special house First 
it makes a button of silk

It uses this button to hang upside down from a twig Then
 it molts for the last time Instead of a new skin this time there is a hard shell 
This shell is called a chrysalis Our caterpillar will stay inside the chrysalis
 for a long time



Every day the chrysalis looks the same We can't see anything 
happening but inside the chrysalis our caterpillar is changing


The caterpillar 
stays in the chrysalis about one week



Will our caterpillar ever turn into a 
butterfly will it ever come out of its chrysalis
 we can hardly wait but we do We
 wait and wait and wait




Then one day during snack time somebody shouts look and we 
all rush over to see


The chrysalis is cracking

We see a head a body and then wings

it's a butterfly



The tiny caterpillar who came to school in a jar turned into a 
Painted Lady butterfly and we saw it happen


Our butterfly is damp and crumpled 

It
 hangs on to the chrysalis while its wings flap flap flap Blood pumps into its 
wings The wings straighten out and dry Soon our butterfly will be ready to fly


In two hours the wings are dry and the butterfly is ready to fly



Our butterfly 
cannot stay in the jar it needs to be outside with flowers and grass and trees 
and other butterflies


It is a warm spring day I put my finger into the jar The 
butterfly sits on my finger I pull it out and our butterfly goes free We feel 
a little sad and a little happy



We watch our butterfly land on a flower It will
 sip the flower's nectar through a long coiled tube called a proboscis Maybe it 
is a female butterfly maybe someday she will lay an egg on a leaf


I know just 
what will happen then That egg will hatch into a caterpillar and that caterpillar
 will turn into a beautiful butterfly



Painted Lady butterflies sip nectar from 
certain flowers They like thistle burdock zinnia butterfly bush and mint
