houses and homes 

The world is full of houses. 
Big houses little houses bright houses white houses 

houses that move and houses that stay 

in a row or all alone 

filled with families just right for one. 

Build your house with what is handy wood or stone or straw or mud or 
almost anything at all. Weave it nail it 

tie it with rope. Build it on stilts! 

Let in the air to keep it cool. Fill in the cracks to keep it warm. 

Fill it with love and make it a home.
