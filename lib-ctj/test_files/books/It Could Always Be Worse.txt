it could always be worse a yiddish folk tale 


Once upon a time in a small village a poor unfortunate man lived with his mother his wife and 
his six children in a little one-room hut because they were so crowded the man and his wife 
often argued the children were noisy and they fought in winter when the nights were long and 
the days were cold life was especially hard the hut was full of crying and quarreling one day 
when the poor unfortunate man couldn't stand it any more he ran to the Rabbi for advice


Holy Rabbi
 he cried things are in a bad way with me and getting worse we are so poor that my mother my wife
 my six children and I all live together in one small hut we are too crowded and there's so much
 noise help me Rabbi I'll do whatever you say the Rabbi thought and pulled on his beard at last he
 said tell me my poor man do you have any animals perhaps a chicken or two yes said the man I do 
have a few chickens also a rooster and a goose fine said the Rabbi now go home and take the 
chickens the rooster and the goose into your hut to live with you yes indeed Rabbi said the man 
though he was a bit surprised


The poor unfortunate man hurried home and took the chickens the rooster
 and the goose out of the shed and into his little hut



When some days or a week had gone by life in
 the hut was worse than before now with the quarreling and crying there was honking crowing and 
clucking there were feathers in the soup the hut stayed just as small and the children grew bigger 
when the poor unfortunate man couldn't stand it any longer he again ran to the Rabbi for help 

Holy 
Rabbi he cried see what a misfortune has befallen me now with the crying and quarreling with the 
honking clucking and crowing there are feathers in the soup Rabbi it couldn't be worse help me 
please the Rabbi listened and thought at last he said tell me do you happen to have a goat yes
 I do have an old goat but he's not worth much excellent said the Rabbi now go home and take the
 old goat into your hut to live with you no do you really mean it Rabbi cried the man come 
come now my good man and do as I say at once said the Rabbi


The poor unfortunate man tramped back
 home with his head hanging down and took the old goat into his hut



When some days or a week had
 gone by life in the little hut was much worse now with the crying quarreling clucking honking 
and crowing the goat went wild pushing and butting everyone with his horns the hut seemed smaller 
the children grew bigger when the poor unfortunate man couldn't stand it another minute he again
 ran to the Rabbi


Holy Rabbi help me he screamed now the goat is running wild my life is a 
nightmare the Rabbi listened and thought at last he said tell me my poor man is it possible that 
you have a cow young or old doesn't matter Yes Rabbi it's true I have a cow said the poor man 
fearfully go home then said the Rabbi and take the cow into your hut  no surely not Rabbi 
cried the man do it at once said the Rabbi



The poor unfortunate man trudged home with a heavy 
heart and took the cow into his hut is the Rabbi crazy he thought


When some days or a week had 
gone by life in the hut was very much worse than before everyone quarreled even the chickens
 the goat ran wild the cow trampled everything the poor man could hardly believe his misfortune 
at last when he could stand it no longer he ran to the Rabbi for help


Holy Rabbi he shrieked help 
me save me the end of the world has come the cow is trampling everything there is no room even 
to breathe it's worse than a nightmare the Rabbi listened and thought at last he said go home
 now my poor unfortunate man and let the animals out of your hut I will I will I'll do it right
 away said the man



The poor unfortunate man hurried home and let the cow the goat the chickens
 the goose and the rooster out of his little hut



That night the poor man and all his family 
slept peacefully there was no crowing no clucking no honking there was plenty of room to breathe 
the very next day the poor man ran back to the Rabbi



Holy Rabbi he cried you have made life sweet
 for me with just my family in the hut it's so quiet so roomy so peaceful what a pleasure
