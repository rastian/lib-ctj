Little Red Riding Hood 

In a small cottage there lived a sweet little girl and her dear mother who once made for her 
daughter a lovely red riding hood the child cherished it and wore it everywhere so that all 
in the village affectionately called her Little Red Riding Hood 
One day Mother cooked some
 delicious chicken soup and raisin muffins your grandmother is not well today she told her 
daughter as she packed the warm treats go see how she is faring mind you little miss she 
instructed be certain to go straight there


Little Red Riding hood set out at once the gentle 
sounds of the child's footsteps in the new snow crunch crunch kept her company how peaceful 
she thought catching a snowflake on the tip of her tongue I wonder if Grandmama will be surprised
 to see me


By and by Little Red Riding Hood met a sly wolf the wolf who was always hungry had a 
mind to eat her up at once but he thought better of it when he heard the chop chop of woodcutters
 working nearby where are you going little one he asked in his most pleasant voice my grandmama 
is not well today Little Red Riding Hood replied forgetting that her mother did not want her to
 delay I'm taking her some chicken soup and raisin muffins


The clever creature smiled does she 
live far from here he asked no said Little Red Riding Hood just behind the mill across from the
 pond next to the big oak tree I'll join you for I was just heading that way said the wolf he
 walked along with the child for a short distance and then had an idea why not collect kindling
 for a fire he suggested it will warm your granny's heart


That's a wonderful idea said the child 
look the snow has brought down many small branches they will make a good fire Little Red Riding 
Hood gathered as many twigs as she could carry tying the bundle with the ribbon that had fastened
 Grandmother's basket


In the meantime the cunning wolf slipped away to Grandmother's cottage with
 great haste tap tap he knocked who's there asked Grandmother in a frail voice it's me your 
granddaughter replied the crafty scoundrel doing his very best to sound like a young girl the 
door is unlocked Grandmother responded just lift the latch


Once inside the wolf leaped upon the 
startled woman and gobbled her down whole then he shut the door and dressed himself in one of 
Grandmother's nightgowns after struggling to get her cap down over his ears the wolf who was
 still quite hungry settled into the bed to wait for his next meal 

Before long Little Red 
Riding Hood arrived at the cottage tap tap she knocked who's there croaked the wolf the girl
 was startled by the hoarseness of Grandmother's voice it's me your granddaughter she responded
 I've brought you soup and Mama's special raisin muffins and I've found kindling to start a fire
 soon you'll feel just like yourself again just lift the latch and come in the voice invited her
 I can't wait to see how much you've grown


The little girl opened the door and closed it gently 
behind her the wolf lay in bed with the sheets right up to his whiskers and Grandmother's
 nightcap pulled as low as he could manage put your basket on the chair and come closer he said
 as sweetly as he could you're a head taller since I saw you last Little Red Riding Hood anxious 
about Grandmother's poor health went right to her bedside


Grandmama what great arms you have 
said the child in wonder all the better to hug you with my dear replied the wolf Grandmama
 what great ears you have she remarked all the better to hear you with my dear the wolf responded


 Grandmama what great eyes you have the girl cried out all the better to see you with my dear 
declared the wolf Grandmama what great teeth you have she squealed all the better to eat you 
with my dear howled the wolf


With those awful words the wolf leaped out from under the covers 
sprang upon Little Red Riding Hood and swallowed her whole


Now said the wolf with a satisfied 
sigh a long nap is all I need after such a full meal and so he climbed back into bed and fell
 asleep the wretched creature snored so loudly that one of the woodcutters who was passing by 
the cottage wondered if something might be wrong with the kindly old woman who lived there as
 the man approached her door he spotted two sets of fresh tracks in the snow leading right to
 the front steps one set is that of a small child he thought the second set appears to be large
 paw prints 

The woodcutter cautiously entered the cottage and made his way toward a noise that
 rumbled so deeply that it caused the china in the cupboard to rattle he thought when he
 found a wolf with a very very large belly in a deep sleep then to the man's great surprise 
its belly stirred


With one stroke of his ax he killed the wolf then he cut open with animal's
 stomach with the old woman's sewing shears


Out jumped Little Red Riding Hood with a smile as 
bright as fresh snow then out climbed the kindly old woman once she saw that her granddaughter 
was out of harm's way her heart was filled with gratitude Grandmother had never felt better


Later after the woodcutter had buried the wicked wolf in the deep forest he returned to warm 
himself by the fireplace where Grandmother had started a fire with Little Red Riding Hood's 
kindling all three were comforted with Mother's chicken soup and raisin muffins the sweet raisins
 reminded the girl of home and of what her mother had told her as Little Red Riding Hood readied
 herself to leave Grandmother said now little miss you be certain to go straight home and she did
