lon po po a red riding hood story from china 



To all the wolves of the world for lending their good name as a tangible symbol for our darkness


Once long ago there was a woman who lived alone in the country with her three children 
Shang Tao and Paotze on the day of their grandmother's birthday the good mother set off to see her 
leaving the three children at home

Before she left she said be good while I am away my heart-loving children I will not return tonight 
remember to close the door tight at sunset and latch it well


But an old wolf lived nearby and saw the good mother leave at dusk disguised as an old woman he 
came up to the house of the children and knocked on the door twice bang bang Shang who was the 
eldest said through the latched door who is it my little jewels said the wolf this is your 
grandmother your Po Po Po Po Shang said our mother has gone to visit you


The wolf acted surprised to visit me I have not met her along the way she must have taken a 
different route Po Po Shang said how is it that you come so late the wolf answered the journey is 
long my children and the day is short


Shang listened through the door Po Po she said why is your voice so low your 
grandmother has caught a cold good children and it is dark and windy out here 
quickly open up and let your Po Po come in the cunning wolf said Tao and Paotze 
could not wait one unlatched the door and the other opened it 
they shouted Po Po Po Po come in at the moment he entered the door the wolf 
blew out the candle Po Po Shang asked why did you blow out the candle 
the room is now dark the wolf did not answer


Tao and Paotze rushed to their Po Po and wished to be hugged 
the old wolf held Tao good child you are so plump he embraced Paotze 
good child you have grown to be so sweet soon the old wolf pretended to be sleepy he yawned 
all the chicks are in the coop he said Po Po is sleepy too 
when he climbed into the big bed Paotze climbed in at one end with the wolf and 
Shang and Tao climbed in at the other 
but when Shang stretched she touched the wolf's tail Po Po Po Po 
your foot has a bush on it


Po Po has brought hemp strings to weave you a basket 
the wolf said Shang touched grandmother's sharp claws 
Po Po Po Po your hand has thorns on it Po Po has brought an awl to make shoes 
for you the wolf said at once Shang lit the light and the wolf blew it out again 
but Shang had seen the wolf's hairy face


Po Po Po Po she said for she was not only the eldest she was the most clever 
you must be hungry have you eaten gingko nuts what is gingko the wolf asked gingko is soft and 
tender like the skin of a baby one taste and you will live forever 
Shang said and the nuts grow on the top of the tree just outside the door 
the wolf gave a sigh oh dear Po Po is old her bones have become brittle no longer can she climb 
trees good Po Po we can pick some for you Shang said 
the wolf was delighted


Shang jumped out of bed and Tao and Paotze came with her to the gingko tree 
there Shang told her sisters about the wolf and all three climbed up the tall tree 
the wolf waited and waited plump Tao did not come back 
sweet Paotze did not come back 
Shang did not come back and no one brought any nuts from the gingko tree 
at last the wolf shouted where are you children 
Po Po Shang called out we are on the top of the tree eating gingko nuts 
good children the wolf begged pluck some for me 
but Po Po gingko is magic only when it is plucked directly from the tree you 
must come and pluck it from the tree yourself


The wolf came outside and paced back and forth under the tree where he heard the three children 
eating the gingko nuts at the top 
Po Po these nuts are so tasty the skin so tender Shang said 
the wolf's mouth began to water for a taste 
finally Shang the eldest and most clever child said Po Po Po Po 
I have a plan at the door there is a big basket behind it is a rope tie the rope to the basket 
sit in the basket and throw the other end to me I can pull you up


The wolf was overjoyed and fetched the basket and the rope then threw one end of the rope 
to the top of the tree Shang caught the rope and began to pull the basket up and up halfway 
she let go of the rope and the basket and the wolf fell to the ground 
I am so small and weak Po Po Shang pretended I could not hold the rope alone 
this time I will help Tao said let us do it again


The wolf had only one thought in his mind to taste a gingko nut 
he climbed into the basket again now Shang and Tao pulled the rope on the basket together higher 
and higher again they let go and again the wolf tumbled down down and bumped his head 
the wolf was furious he growled and cursed we could not hold the rope Po Po Shang said 
but only one gingko nut and you will be well again 
I shall give a hand to my sisters this time Paotze the youngest said this time we shall not fail


Now the children pulled the rope with all of their strength as they pulled they sang  
and the basket rose straight up higher than the first time higher than the second time 
higher and higher and higher until it nearly reached the top of the tree when the wolf reached out he could 
almost touch the highest branch but at that moment Shang coughed and 
they all let go of the rope and the basket fell down and down and down 
not only did the wolf bump his head but he broke his heart to pieces


Po Po Shang shouted but there was no answer 
Po Po Tao shouted but there was no answer 
Po Po Paotze shouted there was still no answer 
the children climbed to the branches 
just above the wolf and saw that he was truly dead 
then they climbed down went into the house closed the door 
locked the door with the latch and fell peacefully asleep


On the next day their mother returned with baskets of food 
from their real Po Po and the three sisters told her the story of the Po Po who had come
