introduction

Several years ago I read a newspaper article about a camel in Kenya that was used to bring books 
to young people who lived in remote desert villages I wondered how else books might be 
brought to children in other parts of the world My research turned up all sorts of mobile 
libraries libraries that moved on legs on wheels and by other means 
I was thrilled to learn how far people would go to put books into the hands of young readers 
I began to contact librarians in faraway places They responded by sharing information 
personal stories and photos of their mobile libraries and of the young people who use them 
Over time I assembled a scrapbook of mobile libraries from all over the world

Developing this book has been a rewarding and exciting experience From Azerbaijan to Zimbabwe 
I discovered people who are passionate about books and who understand the importance of 
libraries in our lives One librarian in Azerbaijan explained that the library is as important 
as air or water

Maybe you have been taking your local library for granted just as I did 
Next time you borrow books think of how lucky you are to be able to choose from all of those 
free books and to take home as many as you wish
The librarians and volunteers who bring books by camel or elephant or by boat 
inspired me I hope they inspire you too

Australia
In Australia there are more than five thousand libraries About seventy-two of those libraries 
are on wheels Some mobile libraries cover the Gold Coast a strip of beaches in the state of 
Queensland that runs north from the border with New South Wales toward Brisbane 
the state capital Huge trucks and trailers carry thousands of books to children who cannot 
go to a library in a city
Travis a librarian travels on one of the trucks He stops at schools to talk about books and to 
tell stories Some stories leave children with something to think about says Travis 
Others bring laughter or tears Stories can get kids excited about books and reading so they 
borrow lots of books
The mobile library that Travis runs is more than a truck It is a solar-powered high-tech library 
The solar panel is on the top of the truck Inside are six computers and a printer powered by a 
UPS uninterrupted power supply unit which is charged from a bank of batteries
The truck comes with three air-conditioning units two banks of fluorescent lights 
nine spotlights and a stereo system with surround sound It also features a wheelchair lift a 
microwave oven a small refrigerator a toilet and two sinks 
All of these units are powered by a bank of constantly recharging batteries 
The solar panel provides a small current to the batteries that keeps them alive and running
Australian readers borrow books from their solar-powered library truck

Azerbaijan
The children in the Kelenterli refugee settlement can't sit still when they know that the blue 
truck is coming The
blue truck library is here thanks to the hard work of Relief International an organization that 
provides relief to victims of natural disasters and civil conflicts
These children live in poverty but the blue library truck brings a surge of 
happiness and curiosity It's a big event when the library comes to town says the librarian 
It's a bit of happiness for children who normally don't have much to look forward to 
This library-in-a-truck has been bringing books to children for several years 
Designed to provide a wide variety of books to young people two library trucks serve over 
sixteen hundred students in about twenty-three refugee schools 
Their goal is simple for a few hours each week the children of Kelenterli and other settlements 
are given the opportunity to borrow books In doing so they may feel they are part of a 
new generation growing up in a new Azerbaijan The trucks travel through only two regions of 
Azerbaijan There are children in other areas of the country who would love to see the blue truck 
pay them a visit But unfortunately there are not enough trucks or books to reach them all 
Relief International is working to change that For us says the librarian the mobile 
library is as important as air or water

When the blue library truck arrives Azerbaijanian children are eager to get their books
Children in Azerbaijan learn about their country's history through books written 
in their own language

Canada
Nunavut which means Our Land in the language of the Inuit people is a huge territory in 
Canada's north The arctic region stretches from the North Pole to Arviat in the south and 
from Kugluktuk in the west to Pangnirtung in the east The distances are huge and many villages 
are very isolated The Northwest Territories reach from Nunavut in the east to the Yukon in the 
west Larger towns like Iqaluit Tuktoyaktuk and Yellowknife have their own public-library 
buildings but many communities are just too small Some communities like Fort Liard have a 
virtual library which offers Internet access But even if the community does not have any kind of 
library building the Northwest Territories public library system offers books to everyone in the 
far north through their Borrower-by-Mail program Tyson Anakvik Colin Igutaaq James Naikak and 
Cameron Ovilok are friends in Cambridge Bay Nunavut They request library books by email or by 
phone A mobile library doesn't bring the books to their village the books are sent through the 
mail The Borrower-by-Mail program will send children any books they'd like to read 
If the library doesn't have a book in its system librarians will borrow the book from another 
library in Canada and mail it They even include a stamped addressed envelope so the children 
won't have to pay to return the book
The boys take their young friend Liza for a ride on their sled as they walk to the post office 
to pick up their books The boys look forward to reading that night On winter days the sun does 
not come above the horizon and when the thermometer reads minus degrees the children like to 
curl up with a good book by the woodstove While the northern wind howls across the tundra they 
read fantasy and action novels Liza is excited about finding good picture books in the package
They can keep their books for up to six weeks After that they'll pack them up and walk to the 
local post office to mail the books back to the library Then they'll check the mail every day 
until another big brown package arrives with new books to devour in their remote corner of 
Canada's Arctic

England
The Blackpool Beach Library brings books directly to people who are enjoying their summer 
holiday at the beach The library is a wheelbarrow Two library assistants cart the books up and 
down the beachÂ Borrowers needn't join the Blackpool Library When they finish reading the books 
they simply return them to the wheelbarrow when it comes by another day The people at the 
Blackpool Library believe that it is important to promote the joy of reading 
Libraries are services not buildings says one librarian So besides donkey rides and 
lemonade stands this beach offers books 
England has other types of mobile libraries as well Share-a-Book is a children's mobile library 
van in Gloucester a county in England A librarian travels with the van to the countryside 
where children don't have access to a regular public library Many children don't have books at 
home to read and share with their parents
Share-a-Book has special books for children for whom English is a second language They also offer 
toddler story times and take part in special celebrations in the area

The Blackpool Library distributes the joy of reading from a wheelbarrow on the beach
Even a donkey likes to put his nose in a book on the beach

Finland
In the middle of Aboland Archipelago is a big water called Gullkrona meaning Golden Crown 
It was given its name by Queen Blanka of Namur According to an old legend while on a voyage 
to Finland Queen Blanka promised her golden crown to the most beautiful thing she would see 
along the way This turned out to be the bay in south of Finland and so she let her crown 
sink into the waves The bay is now called Gullkrona Bay

The south coast of Finland skirts the Gulf of Finland the archipelago in the southwest 
consists of thousands of rocky islands Some islands have only summer visitors 
but others are populated year-round People in this area of Finland speak both Finnish and 
Swedish Since the Pargas Library has been bringing books to the people of these islands 
by book boat in Swedish or in Finnish
The boat called kalkholm meaning Limestone Island in Swedish measures 
meters wide and meters long it carries about six hundred books 
The boat with a crew consisting of a librarian and an assistant sails among the islands 
making about ten stops Kids come scrambling down the rocky shores to collect their books 
Since winters are severe in Finland the boat goes out only from May to October 
Maj-Len the chief librarian in Pargas Stad oversees the operation of the book boat
Reading has become very important to our book-boat children she says If the book boat 
didn't come they might not be reading at all They are always happy to see us and their supply of 
new books

Nomadic Lapps have lived here since the first millennium most Lapps are now settled 
but some still lead nomadic lives and still depend on reindeer for food clothes and shelter
In Northern Lapland four towns share a mobile library bus which also carries children's books 
what makes this bus special is that the service is shared by communities in three 
countries Finland Sweden and Norway

Indonesia
Among the many islands of Indonesia rivers are the main means of transportation 
So it is no wonder that some libraries here float on rivers
The country has seven floating libraries The Kalimantan Floating Library consists of a 
wooden boat meters long and meters wide The boat which is powered by a diesel engine can carry 
up to five hundred books
When the boat first began bringing books to the villages along the river Kahayan it had to stay 
until people finished reading their books That took too much time so the librarians decided to 
leave behind containers filled with books This allowed them to continue traveling the river 
bringing books to other villages Now the children in the villages along the river come running 
when the library boat tugs upstream They are all excited about rummaging through a new box of 
books to read
In the city of Surabaya a bicycle library makes its rounds every day The East Java Library Board 
decided that a bicycle was the most economical way to deliver books to readers 
The library is powered by man and environmentally friendly The bicycle makes it easy to get 
around the narrow winding streets of the city It carries books and promotes reading around the 
city at schools in the countryside in villages and kampongs which are urban communities 
designed to look like villages in the countryside Children and their parents can borrow books 
from the bicycle library and exchange them the next time the library visits

Children from villages along the river come running when Indonesia's floating library tugs into

Kenya
The roads to Bulla Iftin two hundred miles northeast of Nairobi are impassable because of the 
desert sand even for cars with four-wheel drive But young people who live in nomadic villages in 
the area are hungry for books So librarians use the most economical means of transportation 
camels
Library camels are on the road five days a week They can carry heavy loads and need little water 
in the heat of the desert One camel may carry as many as five hundred books weighing about four 
hundred pounds A driver and a librarian divide the books into two boxes 
They saddle them on the camel's back which is covered with a grass mat for protection a second
camel carries a tent that serves as the library roof. 

The students of Bulla Iftin eagerly await the arrival of the camels When the library caravan 
finally reaches the village the children watch as the librarian pitches the tent and displays 
the books on wooden shelves The librarian places the grass mats on the ground in the shade of an 
acacia tree making a place where the children can sit The students can treasure their new books 
for two weeks When the library camels return the children can trade their books for new ones

These young readers are grateful for the books brought by camel
These camels are ready to bring books to children in remote villages

Mongolia
For centuries people in Mongolia have led a nomadic lifestyle moving across the steppe a vast 
grass-covered plain with their herds Many people are still herders of livestock moving with their 
herds as they graze The life of the nomads has not changed very much since the old days except 
that nowadays the herders like to use iron horses meaning motorbikes instead of real horses 
Very few people have telephones television or access to computers but most people can read 
There is almost no illiteracy in this country
Jambyn Dashdondog is a well-known writer of children's books in Mongolia 
He was looking for a way to  bring books to the many children of herders' families who live 
scattered across the Gobi Desert A horse-drawn wagon as well as a camel is used to carry books 
into the desert
Together with the Mongolian Children's Cultural Foundation Mr. Dashdondog was able to obtain a 
minibus and ten thousand books mostly donated by Japan The Japanese books are being translated 
into Mongolian and Mr. Dashdondog makes trips with the minibus to bring the books to children in 
the countryside.
The book tour is called Amttai Nom which means candy books Why Because before they share the 
books the children are given food including some sweets After the children listen to stories and 
choose books Mr. Dashdondog asks Which was sweeter books or candies And the children always 
answer BOOKS
I just returned from a trip to visit herders' children in the Great Gobi Desert said 
Mr. Dashdondog who has visited nearly ten thousand children in the past two years 
We covered some fifteen hundred kilometers in two weeks And this was in winter so it was cold 
and snowy We had no winter fuel for our bus so we had to use summer fuel and the fuel froze at 
night making the bus stall But we weren't cold the stories and their heroes kept us warm

huge part of Europe and Asia the boundaries have often changed under the rule of China and 
Russia since the Mongolian People's Republic has been an independent country with its own 
constitution

Pakistan
 There are not many libraries in Pakistan and libraries for children are especially rare 
Most schools don't have libraries either That is why the Alif Laila Bookbus Society ran a 
children's library in an old double-decker bus But in order to reach more children 
they needed to put a mobile library on the road Thanks to help from the Jersey and Guernsey 
Trust and the United Kingdom's Save the Children they now have a very popular bus that travels 
to schools The bus is called Dastangou or Storyteller
The bus carries about six thousand books in English and Urdu the two official languages of 
Pakistan to children in schools Some schools get a weekly visit but in most places the 
Storyteller can come only once every two weeks This bus full of books has opened up a whole 
new world to children
She explains that there aren't enough books to allow the children to take books home 
If we did there wouldn't be enough books to take to the next school Tabbassum twelve says 
The first time the Storyteller came I ran to it and picked up a book of poetry  
I started copying verses from it because I didn't know if it would ever come again 
But then Miss Nosheen who travels with the bus told me not to worry It would visit every 
Tuesday That really made me happy

Before the storyteller book bus came these Pakistani children didn't have access to books

Papua New Guinea
In Papua New Guinea no roads lead to the remote jungle hamlets or to the schools that serve 
them Volunteers from Hope Worldwide a non-profit charitable organization based in 
Philadelphia are committed to bringing books to people in this area of Papua New Guinea 
They begin their journey in a four-by-four truck on a road cut into the steep hillside 
After a long bumpy ride they eventually come to a village called Mogi-agi which means 
up-and-down road a perfect description for the surrounding landscape.
At Mogi-agi students and their teacher file out of the school to greet the volunteers 
They are all excited about receiving a new supply of books But the volunteers aren't done yet 
They still have to reach a further destination deeper in the jungle the village of Amia 
They ford a river in their truck and drive until they can go no farther 
Then they unload the boxes of books to take them to the small villages in the highlands 
From here they must walk for four hours up the pass and over several ridges crossing log bridges 
while carrying the boxes of books on their shoulders 
They head up the valley to where the trail stops Along the way people who live along the 
trail bring sugarcane to the volunteers

When they finally reach Amia young people come running to meet them 
The volunteers have come to help them start a library The young people help carry books and 
supplies into the school The volunteers have brought over a hundred books on their backs 
And books are not the only things they deliver They also bring desperately needed medicines 
such as antibiotics and aspirin The people of 
Amia gratefully read their books and look forward to the next supply
The smile of a child holding a book is enough reward for the volunteers 
who carry boxes of books into the jungle of Papua New Guinea
So many happy readers in Papua New Guinea

Peru
Children in Peru can receive their books in several different innovative ways 
CEDILI-IBBY Peru is an institution that delivers books in bags to families in lima
Each bag contains twenty books which families can keep for a month The books come in four 
different reading levels so that children really learn how to read The project in Spanish is 
called and enables parents to share the joy of books with their children.
In small rural communities books are delivered in wooden suitcases and plastic bags 
These suitcases and bags contain books that the community can keep and share for the next 
three months The number of books in each suitcase depends on the size of the community 
There are no library buildings in these small towns and people gather outside in the plaza to 
see the books they can check out
In the coastal regions books are sometimes delivered by donkey cart The books are stored in the 
reading promoter's home
In the ancient city of Cajamarca reading promoters from various rural areas select and receive a 
large collection of books for their area The program is called Aspaderuc The reading promoter 
lends these books to his or her neighbors and after three months a new selection of books goes 
out to each area Books in this system are for children and adults
And last but not least  brings a collection of children's books to rural schools 
The books are brought from school to school by wagon The children who are excited about 
browsing through the books when they arrive are turning into avid readers

Some Peruvian readers receive their books by donkey cart

Thailand
In Omkoi a region of northern Thailand there are no schools or libraries Tribal people 
cannot read or write The government of Thailand hopes to change that with a literacy program 
that includes bringing books to remote villages in the jungle
A number of these villages can be reached only on foot This makes transportation 
difficult especially during the rainy season How do you get books to people who need them most 
when they live in hard-to-reach mountainous regions of northern Thailand Elephants
The Chiangmai Non-Formal Education Center had the idea to use elephants as libraries 
Elephants are already being used here to plow the paddy fields and to carry logs and crops 
Now more than twenty elephants in the Omkoi region are used to carry books 
The elephant teams spend two to three days in each village Each trip covers seven or eight 
villages so it takes each elephant team eighteen to twenty days to complete a round-trip

The Books-by-Elephant delivery program serves thirty-seven villages providing education for 
almost two thousand people in the Omkoi region They have even designed special metal slates 
that won't break when carried on the elephants' backs across the rough terrain 
These slates are used to teach Thai children to write and read 
There are also two-person teams carrying books to about sixteen villages bringing 
learning materials to another six hundred people
In Bangkok the capital of Thailand old train carriages have been transformed into a library 
The train is called Hong Rotfai Yoawachon which means Library Train for Young People 
The train serves the homeless children of The Railway Police Division in Bangkok realized there 
was a need for a safe place for street children so they refurbished the old train carriages at 
the railway station where many of the kids were hanging out The police restored the trains to 
their old glory complete with wood paneling and shining copper light fixtures 
They turned the railway cars into a library and a classroom Here the children learn to read and 
write The police have even transformed the area around the train into a garden where they 
grow herbs and vegetables

The elephant library is headed for remote villages in Northern Thailand

Zimbabwe
Many small communities are spread throughout rural Zimbabwe 
Bulawayo is a city within the Bulawayo province in western Zimbabwe between North and South 
Matabeleland provinces Outside of Bulawayo there are few paved roads 
People travel either on foot or by donkey cart along the sandy trails And donkey carts carry 
library books as well 
Rachel a library volunteer worked in Bulawayo Once a week she would load boxes of 
books onto a small wooden cart drawn by a donkey the Nkayi Donkey Mobile Library Cart 
The Rural Libraries and Resources Development Programme is hoping to nurture reading skills 
among the young people of rural Zimbabwe The donkey cart can reach small communities that are 
inaccessible to vehicles because of the bad roads Boxes of books delivered by donkey cart are 
left at schools in different communities for a month at a time
We would load boxes of books into the cart Rachel says and walk for hours along the 
dusty roads to reach different villages We'd leave the books in the local schools 
Then the children and adults would come to the schools to check out the books 
We tried to keep the library running on a regular schedule Rachel adds laughing 
But sometimes we couldn't catch the donkeys and then we'd be late 
One of the Rural Libraries and Resources Programme's brand-new carts is a 
donkey-driven electro-communications library cart It brings not only books but also 
a solar-powered
TV and VCR to children who have never watched TV in their lives The library plans to add a 
computer and satellite dish to bring Internet and fax capabilities to this semiarid 
region of Zimbabwe in the near future
Rachel was not surprised that the children enjoyed picture books 
Since this is an agricultural society older readers want books on farming 
Books in the native language are very popular as are good books from the West 
But the children like African literature the best even if it is in English

Librarians promote literacy in rural Zimbabwe
Children in Zimbabwe like children everywhere love a good book to read
