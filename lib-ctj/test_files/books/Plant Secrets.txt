Plants have found many different ways to grow and reproduce 
Most plants like peas oak trees roses and tomatoes follow the stages described in this book 
seed plant flower and fruit Some stages are more important to people 
the flower stage of roses or the fruit stage of tomatoes 
But all the stages are important to the plant 
Seed A seed is a packet holding a young plant and food for the plant to use as it sprouts

Peas Peas are related to beans wisteria vines and redbud trees 
All these plants have similar pea flowers upper and lower lips of petals around an open mouth 
Peas are originally from Europe and the Middle East and have been eaten there 
since prehistoric times Today they are planted all around the world 
We usually eat the seed the pea but some kinds of peas are bred to make the fruit 
the pod tender and tasty You can grow fresh peas indoors on a windowsill 
Plant Once it has sprouted a plant can make its own food from sunlight 
People and animals cannot do this We know oak trees best in their plant stage

Oak trees Oaks grow in many parts of the world 
They are some of the largest trees in the forest and can live to be hundreds of years old 
Many kinds of oak grow strong hard trunks that can be used to make 
almost any wooden object people need 
houses furniture wood floors ships wagons barrels or tools 
Oak seeds found inside the acorn the fruit are eaten by many kinds of animals 
bears deer birds ducks and of course squirrels 
Even people can eat certain kinds of acorns if they are made into flour for bread 
Flower Flowers help the plant reproduce When we think of a flower we usually 
picture its petals But other parts of the flower can grow into a fruit 
after the petals fall off We know roses best in their flower stage

Roses Roses are part of a large family of plants that includes 
apples cherries almonds peaches and hawthorn trees 
We usually grow roses for their beautiful flowers and those kinds often don't form fruits 
But other kinds of roses still produce fruits from flowers These fruits 
called rose hips are usually red and look a little like small apples 
Rose hips are high in vitamin They taste sour so they're not good to eat 
by themselves but people make jelly and tea from them 
Birds foxes raccoons and many other animals eat rose hips 
Fruit A fruit is a container for new seeds Some containers are soft and good to eat 
Animals eat them and drop the seeds on the ground Other containers are hard 
They protect the seeds through hot and cold weather until they're ready to grow 
We know tomatoes best in their fruit stage

Tomatoes Tomatoes are originally from South America Central America and Mexico Tomato flowers and leaves 
look like those of deadly nightshade a European plant with poisonous 
fruits When explorers first brought tomatoes to Europe people there were 
afraid to eat them because they thought tomato fruits might be poisonous too 
To scientists tomatoes are fruits because they are the part of the plant that 
contains the seeds But because tomatoes don't taste sweet most people think of them as vegetables
