Shades of People


Have you noticed that people come in many different shades Not colors exactly but shades There's creamy ivory sandy and peach coffee cocoa copper and tan There's pink rose and almond shades of gold bronze and brown Some people have skin that is very dark others are pale fair or light Our skin is just our covering like wrapping paper And you can't tell what someone is like from the color of their skin Even in the same family there can be many shades At my school there are many different shades It's hard to get the right shade when I paint I see lots of shades at the playground and in the park And at the beach too I see even more shades when I'm in the city In the world there's light and dark and everything in between
