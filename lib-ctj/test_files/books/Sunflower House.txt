Sunflower House

First I pull out all the weeds Then I sow my sunflower seeds It says to set them in a line but Dad says round and round is fine I give them water everyday and shoo the pesky birds away Go eat the berries on the tree These sunflower seeds belong to me The package says they're guaranteed A mammoth flower grows from each seed My friend Bernice says There's no way You don't know everything I say Wait The stems poke up all ringed around a pale green circle in the ground They're growing tall they're growing fast And my Sunflowers at last All frilly yellow big and bright mammoth is the word all right Their petals open wide and spread a golden roof above my head My friends come rushing down to see the sunflower house hand grown by me There's lots of room inside for three Mom brings us cookies and iced tea But Mom and Dad can't fit at all They're much too big and wide and tall All summer long the house is ours We play in it for hours and hours It's a castle it's a cage we're jungle beasts that roar and rage My 
friends sleep out with me one night bundled up and snuggled tight Moon shadows shiver on the ground The sunflowers whisper all around They whisper songs of heat and rain and things too secret to explain I see the stars play peek a boo and wish a wish that can't come true One day the leaves are tinged with brown A flower comes tumbling rumbling down Next day some more bend over fall And now it's not a house at all We tie it up with string and sticks but it's impossible to fix It's gone there's nothing we can do not even with the Glues All glue Wait There's still the puffy middle part that's filled with seeds enough to start another sunflower house next spring with walls a roof and everything It's neat to think when something's gone a part of it goes on and on It's such a plan We pick out all the seeds we can Our pockets bulge The bluejays come the sparrows crows they all take some We still have lots and lots to share Now be aware Prepare Take care Next summer they'll be everywhere
