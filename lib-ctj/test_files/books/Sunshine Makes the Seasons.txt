sunshine makes the seasons




Sunshine warms the earth
If the sun stopped shining the earth would get colder and colder We would freeze 
The whole earth would freeze

The sun shines all through the year but we are warmer in the summer than in winter. 
The amount of sunshine makes the difference
The earth spins around or rotates once in twenty-four hours. That's why we have day and night. 
When we are on the sun side of the earth there is daylight. As the earth rotates we turn away from 
the sun there is sunset and then night

At the same time that the earth spins it goes around the sun. 
The earth takes a year to make one trip around the sun
During a year the length of our day changes. In winter the days are short. 
It may be dark by the time you get home from school. 
It is cold because we don't get many hours of sunshine

As we move into spring days become a bit longer by summer they are even longer 
The days may be so long that it is still light when you go to bed 
It is warm because we get many hours of sunshine 
After the long days of summer the days begin to get shorter and cooler It is fall and time to go 
back to school

All through the year the earth has been rotating once in twenty-four hours giving us day and night 
and all through the year the lengths of darkness and daylight have been changing 
The seasons have been changing too

You can see the reason for these changes by using on orange for the earth a pencil and a 
flashlight Push a pencil through an orange from top to bottom


The top is the North Pole You can mark it with an The bottoms is the South Pole 
Using a marking pen draw a line around the orange halfway between the poles. 
That's the equator stick a pin in the orange about halfway between the equator 
and the North Pole imagine this is where you live

Turn the pencil and the orange The pencil is the axis of the orange
The earth also has an axis There is nothing like a pencil through the earth 
but the earth spins as though there were something like a pencil running from pole to pole

Hold the axis of the orange straight up and down in a darkened room have someone shine a 
flashlight on the orange


The light is supposed to be the sun The part of the orange toward the flashlight is in 
daylight the other half is in darkness
Daylight falls on the North Pole and also the South Pole even when you spin the orange

I'm getting dizzy

Walk all around the flashlight Keep the light shining on the orange 
That would be the same as the earth going all around the sun It would be a year 
Keep the axis straight up and down



Wherever you are as you circle the flashlight the orange is lighted from pole to pole 
All through the year and all over the earth days and nights would be the same length 
There would be no change in seasons

But we know that does not happen on the earth The days get shorter and then longer as the earth 
goes around the sun and winter changes to summer It's because the axis of the earth is not 
straight up and down it is tilted


Let's experiment with the orange This time tilt the axis the way it is tilted in the picture 
That's the way the earth's axis is tilted 
Hold the orange so the North Pole is tilted away from the flashlight

North Pole
Turn the orange all the way around and you will see that the pin is in the light 
only a short time The northern half of the earth has short days and long nights 
Sunlight does not fall on the North Pole the North Pole has its long winter night 
it is winter and it is cold


Keep the axis of the orange tilted in the same direction and go partway around the flashlight 
Now the light falls on both poles It is springtime in the north days are getting longer

Without changing the tilt of the axis move until you are halfway around the flashlight 
from where you started Soon the North Pole will be tilted toward the light it is summer


Smile
North Pole
As you turn the orange the pin is in the light longer than it is in the dark 
The northern half of the earth has long days and short nights 
the North Pole has its long summer day it is summer and it is warm

I'm still dizzy
Summer
Spring
Winter
Fall
Keep moving around the flashlight remember always keep the orange tilted in the same direction 
You'll see that once again light falls on both the North Pole and the South Pole of the orange 
It is fall in the north the days are getting shorter and cooler too
Keep moving around and you come back to winter


They happen because sunshine makes the seasons and because the axis of the earth is tilted. 

The southern half of the earth has seasons too 
They are the opposites of our seasons 
When it is summer and we are going to the beach people on the southern half of the earth 
have winter They are skating and skiing

Good afternoon
Sure us a beautiful day
I'm tired
It's way past my bedtime
North Pole 
The North Pole and the South Pole also have seasons 
Their winters are cold and dark The sun does not rise every day it is dark all winter long
During summer at the poles the sun does not set every day for several weeks there is no night

North Pole
North Pole
Seasons at the poles are opposite When the North Pole has winter 
the South Pole has summer 
Six months later when it is winter at the South Pole it is summer at the North Pole


Along the equator it is warm all the time the temperature stays about the same all through the year 
you can see why if you experiment with the orange Move the pin to the equator
Watch the pin to see what happens as you go through a year You'll see that day and night are 
just about the same length in summer and winter spring and fall

That's good if you like warm weather all the time but it's also nice to see snow 
once in a while to see the flowers and birds of springtime to go swimming in summer and 
have pumpkins in the fall

Year after year the days change and so do the seasons we have winter spring summer and fall 
because the sun warms the earth and because the axis of the earth is tilted

The sun has been giving off light for the last billion years

Light traveling at miles per second takes about eight minutes to travel from the sun to the earth

The sun's temperature is degrees Fahrenheit at the surface and degrees Fahrenheit at the center

The average distance from the earth to the sun is miles

The sun is so large that million planets the size of earth could fit inside it

The sun spins around once every days

The highest temperature ever recorded in the United States was degrees Fahrenheit 
at Death Valley California in July

The hottest temperature ever recorded anywhere on the planet was degrees Fahrenheit
