Celebrating the Seasons


The Puzzled Pumpkins


PLAYERS 
PUMPKINS 
LITTLE 
 the play opens PUMPKINS are located about the stage preferably arranged on steps or risers to 
approximate the look of a pumpkin patch Actors will not need to move from place to place so they 
should be placed so each is visible to the audience


PUMPKIN waving arms and wailing dramatically  is me
 woe woe

PUMPKIN hands sweeping to show rest of patch  is you Woe is us 

PUMPKIN Here we are stuck in the 
patch just growing and growing


PUMPKIN complaining And for what We sit here like a bunch of old orange bumps on a log waiting 
for someone to come along and pick us out of the crowd


PUMPKIN disgustedly And won't that be fun We spend our childhoods sitting here watching life pass 
us by


PUMPKIN Then they cut us free to fulfill our grown-up purpose


PUMPKIN Yes we grow up so that they can poke at us yank out our seeds boil us or bake us What a 
life


LITTLE PUMPKIN bewildered But who are they


PUMPKIN They are people You know humans They take us from the vine and snapping fingers 
just like that it's over Dramatically  woe is us


PUMPKIN You know I think you guys are looking at this thing all wrong We pumpkins are part 
of a grand and glorious tradition


LITTLE PUMPKIN We are What tradition Tell me


PUMPKIN Well we are a native American fruit We were here when the Pilgrims arrived


PUMPKIN And we play an important part in more than one fun holiday tradition


PUMPKIN Yes I've always wanted to grow up to be a  with a happy face


PUMPKIN Personally I'd prefer to be part of a dramatic centerpiece on a Thanksgiving dinner table


PUMPKIN Well not me I was born to be a mouth-watering pumpkin bread


PUMPKIN negatively What kind of life is that Three gulps and you are gone


PUMPKIN No no no You are still not seeing the point We pumpkins have a lot to offer


PUMPKIN Yes we are many things to many people Me I like to think of myself as a trim healthful 
side dish


PUMPKIN That's true What could be better than a slab of baked pumpkin with just a sprinkle of 
brown sugar and nutmeg


PUMPKIN spreading hands to give credit to previous speakers and besides all these fabulous job 
opportunities think of how important we are in stories


PUMPKIN Yes without us where would Cinderella be


PUMPKIN I'll tell you where Without us she'd never get out of the garden


PUMPKIN And don't forget about Mother Goose Where would she be without us


PUMPKIN That's true Remember Peter Peter pumpkin-eater


PUMPKIN thinking carefully Fellow pumpkins maybe some of us haven't been looking at this whole 
situation the right way


PUMPKIN Yes when you get right down to it right down through history we've been playing a 
fine part


PUMPKIN I guess that's true There are a lot worse things than sitting on a dinner table no 
matter what part of the meal you are


PUMPKIN Well I hope I get to choose the job in my future


PUMPKIN Why is that


PUMPKIN Because if I had my choice I'd like to be a nice slab of steaming pumpkin pie


PUMPKIN Yeah  you know with ice cream on top


PUMPKIN With such a wide range of job opportunities how will we choose


LITTLE PUMPKIN Well I don't care which job I get I always say get a job and do it well 
That's the best way


ALL PUMPKINS That's the pumpkin way

prop Place several music stands among the girls if available They can be pantomiming practice 
of a Vivaldi piece if you choose Tape the piece and use a cassette recorder that you or a 
stage assistant can press on and off easily For this play you will also need to have 
readily available for similar playing the first thirty to sixty seconds of each of the first 
movements of Vivaldi's Four Seasons concertos


Enter TEACHERS 


TEACHER clapping hands Girls girls Today is our big open house You will have visitors all day


TEACHER Please be as helpful as you can to Maestro Vivaldi He is trying to finish some music 
for tomorrow's big concert


TEACHER Here comes the first group of visitors now They are here to see our school and 
especially our famous all-girl string orchestra led by our famous teacher Maestro Antonio Vivaldi


Enter VISITORS 1-5 and exit TEACHERS 1-3 At the same time but from another part of the stage 
VIVALDI enters with some white papers that are supposed to be new compositions


VIVALDI passing papers to orchestra Girls 
visitors Perhaps you can help me I am working on several compositions


STRING Are these the four concertos you call the Four Seasons


VIVALDI Yes they are but I am having trouble figuring out which season is which 
And I think spring is the most difficult for me to write


STRING Let's play the music and see what we all think 

VIVALDI nods 
STRINGS raise cardboard versions of instruments and pretend to play as the sounds of the 
winter concerto are played 
VIVALDI conducts by waving his hands to the music When the music stops he waves hands as 
though he has told the girls to stop playing They put their instruments in their laps


VISITOR That was beautiful girls You all played so well


VISITOR Well you know this orphanage is famous for its excellent all-girl orchestra


VIVALDI But let's get back to the point What do you think What season was that


VISITOR That is a very hard question Maestro I hear many things in the music


VISITOR I heard sounds that seemed dark and threatening 


VISITOR Parts of the music sound like a great storm coming


STRING That's it I think our visitors have very good ears I think that was winter Maestro 
with its dark threatening storms


VIVALDI Very good That's settled Now girls the next piece


He raises his hands to conduct while girls raise their instruments 
VISITORS leave as VISITORS enter The taped music is played it is the first part of the first 
movement of the autumn concerto When the music stops 
VIVALDI waves his hands to stop, and the girls put their instruments in their laps


VISITOR That was beautiful girls You all play so well


VISITOR Well you know this orphanage is famous for its excellent all-girl orchestra


VIVALDI But let's get back to the point What do you think What season was that


VISITOR That's a very hard question Maestro I hear many things in the music


VISITOR The music seems very active and busy


VISITOR Part of the music sounds as though creatures are busy making ready for a coming change


STRING That's it I think our visitors have very good ears I think that was autumn 
Maestro with the sounds of squirrels busily preparing for winter


VIVALDI Very good That's settled Now girls the next piece

He raises his hands to conduct while the girls raise their instruments 
VISITORS leave as VISITORS enter The taped music begins at the first part of the first 
concerto for summer When the music ends the girls put down their instruments in their laps


VISITOR That was beautiful girls You all play so well


VISITOR Well you know this orphanage is famous for its excellent all-girl orchestra


vivaldi But let's get back to the point What do you think What season was that


VISITOR That is a very hard question Maestro I hear many things in the music


VISITOR I heard sounds that seemed lazy and tired


VISITOR Parts of the music sounded like the sleepiness you feel when it's hot


STRING That's it I think our visitors have very good ears I think that was summer 
Maestro with its slow hot breezes


Exit VISITORS and enter VISITORS 

VIVALDI Very good but now comes the most difficult of all 
All that is left is spring


STRING But spring is a wonderful time of year Maestro


STRING Yes it's a time of busy happy activity in the bright warm sunshine


STRING Spring is so full of possibilities


VISITORS Each VISITOR makes one statement about what spring is like 
These statements should be different from those made by STRINGS 
The entire class can work on these lines or the individual players can make up their own lines 
Examples are In spring the trees and flowers are budding 
In spring the animals are having babies While these exchanges are underway 
VIVALDI is busy making notes and checking the girls' music on their stands


vivaldi These are all very good ideas Let's hope that you hear spring in this next piece 
Optional If not it's back to the composition book for me


Girls raise instruments and VIVALDI raises arms to conduct

The VISITORS look on The taped music plays the first part of the first movement 
of the spring concerto When the music ends the girls put their instruments in their laps


STRING Maestro that's it That's definitely spring


VISITORS AND STRINGS all together  words of congratulations and stating simple things 
about how the music sounds like spring It's Wonderful So playful So full of life 
It is definitely spring


TEACHERS rush in


TEACHER Maestro we heard your music from the hall


TEACHER It is wonderful more wonderful than any before.


TEACHER I was sure that I heard the sounds of spring in that last piece


TEACHER Yes The music reminded me of trees as they bud with new green leaves


TEACHER It reminded me of wildflowers blooming


TEACHER it made me happy just to hear it Can you play it again 
Can you play the sounds of spring


VIVALDI smiling and proud With pleasure Girls

He raises his hands to conduct, and the girls raise their instruments to play 
Taped music of the first movement of the spring concerto is played again as one student states 
over the sounds of the music Thank you for coming to our play. 
May it bring a little spring to your day

the play opens CHILDREN are seated randomly about the stage SUN and SUNSPOTS are 
located at center stage


CHILD Boy is it hot I'm sweating like crazy


CHILD I think this is what they call a heat wave


CHILD Well I'd like to wave good-bye to this heat


CHILD It's so hot I don't feel like doing anything


CHILD Yeah we've been waiting for the warm weather and now it's too hot to skate or bike


CHILD I wish that old sun would just go on vacation for a day


CHILD Then it would cool off and we could have so much fun


ALL CHILDREN What a summer bummer


SUN Hey 


CHILD Did you hear something


SUN Hey you kids down there 


CHILD I heard something too Who is it 
CHILDREN all look around puzzled

 
SUN It's me


CHILD Me who


SUN Me the sun


CHILDREN all together The sun


CHILD Don't be silly The sun is million miles away You can feel its heat and see its light 
but it doesn't talk

 CHILD How do you know Maybe it's some kind of miracle


CHILD The sun is a whole bunch of hot hydrogen gas and hydrogen gas just doesn't talk


CHILD I don't know Some grown-ups say that people who talk a lot are full of hot air 
That sounds a lot like what you're talking about


SUN I don't know how it happened but I am the sun and I am talking to you 


CHILDREN all together Wow


CHILD What do you want to talk about


SUNSPOT Well you do nothing but complain about the sun


SUNSPOT We're sorry you are hot but we don't think you appreciate what you have because 
of the sun


SUNSPOT And most of what the sun gives you is good


CHILD Tell us about it


SUN Why don't we have a few of our friends tell you about all we do


CHILDREN and talking together Okay We're ready We're listening


SUNSPOT Let the parade begin


CHILD Look here come some plants

Enter PLANTS 

PLANT The sun told us you all needed some straightening out


PLANT We don't want the sun to go away, not even for a day


PLANT Without the sun the Earth would freeze and seeds would not sprout


PLANT Without the sun we couldn't grow the fruits and vegetables that you eat                      


CHILD that's okay We'll just eat milk and eggs and meat


PLANT You think so Well here come some friends who can set you straight about that

Exit PLANTS and enter cows 

cow You children don't understand If the sun were not here to make 
plants grow we wouldn't be here to give you milk and food to eat


cow Yes Without the sun to make grass and plants grow we would have nothing to eat


cow And if we have nothing to eat we can't live And if we can't live we can't make milk for you to drink


cow And besides without the sun we'd all freeze no matter how many layers of fur we had


CHILD We wouldn't freeze We'd just turn on the heat

cows laugh


cow Maybe you want to think about that again I see some friends coming who can clue you in on that

Exit cows and enter FOSSIL FUELS 


FOSSIL FUEL We hear you kids think you can get by without the sun just by turning on the heat


FOSSIL FUEL Don't you realize you get your heat from the sun no matter how you turn it on


FOSSIL FUEL Yes if you use solar power that is power collected from the sun's 


FOSSIL FUEL And if you burn coal or wood for a fire your heat comes from either a tree that the sun
 grew or a fossil deep in the Earth


FOSSIL FUEL And fossils deep in the Earth used to be living things that grew because of the sun 
So you see it all starts with the sun


FOSSIL FUEL Well we've got to go now but here are some friends to tell you about other things the sun gives you

Exit FOSSIL FUELS and enter MOON SUNRISE SUNSET and EARTH 


MOON If you kids sent the sun on vacation, you would never see me.


CHILDREN  speaking at the same time Why I We don't understand How does that work


MOON When you see me you are seeing the sun's light reflecting off me


SUNRISE And what about me What would life be like if you could never see a beautiful sunrise


SUNSET Don't forget me A sunset is at least as pretty as a sunrise


EARTH But down to basics kids Without the sun there wouldn't be life as we know it 
The Earth wouldn't even be in orbit in the solar system


CHILDREN It wouldn't Why not


EARTH Because without the pull of gravity from the sun the Earth would just spin off into space

MOON SUNRISE SUNSET and EARTH exit CHILDREN remain on stage with 
SUN and SUNSPOTS


CHILD Wow I never thought of all those things the sun does for us


CHILD Yeah without the sun nothing would be like it is


CHILD Nothing would be period There would be no life without the sun's heat and light


CHILD I guess I can stand a little heat wave


CHILD Yeah pass the sunscreen and let's celebrate the sun

that children make with classroom percussion instruments

And then we wind down stops moving

YO-YO brother You are so whiny Look at us


YO-YO All we do is roll down and up down and up down and up

YO-YO When a child plays with us they work hard to learn how to use us

the play opens a large book the dictionary is propped up in the center of the stage 
It can be made out of pieces of posterboard and decorated to look like a book 
It should have several posterboard pages that can be turned 
CHILDREN gather around the book


CHILD This is an interesting dictionary It's a dictionary of holiday words isn't it


CHILD Yes And mostly it's about New Year holidays


CHILD We thought this book might help us come up with some new ideas for our New Year party


CHILD That sounds like fun


CHILD Look Here's a phrase I haven't heard before I wonder what New Year custom it is about


CHILD What's the phrase


CHILD It's soba noodle
 As children say the words soba noodle use some lighting effect to signal that something unusual is happening 
The effect can be achieved by flashing stage lights or turning stage lights down or off and having several children with flashlights 
move their light beams in circles around the stage This goes on for only a few seconds perhaps enough time to get actors 
onto the stage and then the stage lights return to normal While the effect is underway 
JAPAN enter They are in the middle of a discussion All players hold small bowls


JAPAN we just love soba noodles and hot soup for New Year here in Japan 
Players look into each other's bowls

JAPAN 4 It's a long noodle but I can do it After all it's for good luck

Lighting effect occurs and JAPAN 1-4 exit

They were different from each other in some ways but not so different in others

Unfortunately in those days the people could only see the ways in which they were different from each other 
They fought all the time Why

BLUE PERSON and ORANGE PERSON stop their pantomime to face the audience and speak


BLUE PERSON Why We fight with the Purple People because pausing thoughtfully they are not blue


ORANGE PERSON Why We fight with the Green People because pausing thoughtfully they are not orange

At this moment 
the actors on stage stop and listen and all the different players from the color groups start fighting and 
yelling at each other

PURPLE PEOPLE laugh as they exit ORANGE PEOPLE limp and stagger offstage Enter RED PEOPLE


RED PERSON I know nobody is ahead of us We'll get to the mountain first and the treasure will be ours


RED PERSON How do you know How can you be sure 

RED PERSON We know we're first because we cheated You don't 
we'd leave winning the treasure to chance do you 

RED PERSON But that's not fair

 RED PERSON Fair is taking care of yourself first 
and the others 
Who cares 


Exit RED PEOPLE The stage is empty The COURT JESTERS bring the secret on stage It is a box with a poster 
on the front that reads Be kind Treat others as you would like to be treated On the back side it reads 
Peace It is covered by a cloth When the prop is in place with COURT JESTERS guarding it the 
PEOPLE all colors begin to arrive They can ad-lib arguing about who arrived first 


RED PERSON So what is the big secret anyway What's the treasure
 The COURT JESTERS lift the cloth to show the sign 
Enter RULER and COURT ADVISOR


PURPLE PERSON What kind of secret is that Do you call that a treasure


GREEN PERSON Yes where is the treasure 

COURT ADVISOR If you know the secret you can make the treasure


ORANGE PERSON What is this Riddle time Just tell us What's the treasure 
COURT JESTERS turn over the sign On the flip side the 
word peace is written in large letters


RULER Now the treasure is within your grasp Go home and try to find it in your lives

The PEOPLE of all colors begin to exit but as they do they start to change a little They are walking slowly offstage 
while the following exchanges occur                  


PURPLE PERSON I don't get it to ORANGE PERSON Are you still hungry Here's a bit of bread


ORANGE PERSON Thank you Do you need a wrap to warm yourself


GREEN PERSON to BLUE PERSON Here let me move this obstacle out of the way


RED PERSON I'll help you I know the way back home


NARRATOR After that day little by little the Ruler's people began to change They thought about the 
secret and what true treasure was Ever so slowly they made peace

CHILD Yes what a wonderful harvest it is


CHILD Think how much money we will make at market with these beautiful pears


FARMER Yes children we are very lucky We will make lots of money with these pears
 
The POOR WANDERERS enter and approach the FARMER and his her CHILDREN


POOR WANDERER  Farmer you have so many beautiful pears, and we are so poor and hungry


POOR WANDERER May we have just one pear to share among us


FARMER How dare you beg from us Go away


CHILD We must get to market with our pears We worked hard for them


POOR WANDERER But you have so many


POOR WANDERER Surely you can spare just one 

CHILD 2 angrily Can't you hear We said no 

CHILD 3 angrily Now go Leave us at once

During this time the TOWNSPEOPLE gather around and listen to the dispute


TOWNSPERSON I can't believe you Farmer

 TOWNSPERSON You are so greedy

 TOWNSPERSON These poor people asked for only one pear


TOWNSPERSON How can you be so heartless and say no when you have so many
 
FARMER This is none of your business Leave us alone

TOWNSPERSON to the WANDERERS Here is a pear to share Will that be enough

The WANDERERS pantomime breaking the pear apart to share it with each other 

POOR WANDER Thank you so much It is more than enough 
because we have pears of our own We want to share them with all of you


TOWNSPERSON How can that be You said you were hungry and needed a pear 

TOWNSPERSON We don't understand 
How can you share pears with us when you have no pears but the one you just received


TOWNSPERSON And besides if you have pears of your own why didn't you just eat them


TOWNSPERSON Why did you ask the farmer for his pears 

POOR WANDERER Well we needed a few seeds You will see Watch

One of the WANDERERS pulls out a hand shovel and pantomimes breaking up the earth The others drop their seeds on this spot 
The TOWNSPEOPLE crowd around this spot and the FARMER and his her CHILDREN leave their cart and go watch the WANDERERS 
Some of the TOWNSPEOPLE crowd in front of the FARMER'S cart and remove that part of the prop that shows the FARMER'S pears 
As the TOWNSPEOPLE crowd around the FARMER the actor playing the

PEAR TREE gets into place where the WANDERER was hoeing This actor crouches down in a ball


TOWNSPERSON Look one of the pear seeds is growing
 Actors clear area of stage in front of PEAR TREE

 TOWNSPERSON 
And so fast It is a miracle
 As TOWNSPEOPLE speak PEAR TREE stands and grows by spreading arms

 TOWNSPERSON The tree is full of pears


TOWNSPERSON They are the biggest most beautiful pears I've ever seen


PEAR TREE The pears of my branches grow many and sweet There are no others like them


TOWNSPERSON How could the tree grow so fast


TOWNSPERSON Those look like the tastiest pears ever


TOWNSPERSON It must be magic


TOWNSPERSON Wanderer tell us how you worked your magic


POOR WANDERER Here There are pears enough for all of you

Posterboard pears are taped with masking tape onto the PEAR TREE'S tree-crown prop see Perform It section following script

thanks and talk among themselves about how good the pears are


TOWNSPERSON Thank you so much Wanderers


TOWNSPERSON The pears were wonderful 

TOWNSPERSON You were so generous Many thanks to you


TOWNSPERSON Now that the pears are gone what will you do


POOR WANDERER What will we do We will do this 
A WANDERER proceeds to chop down tree with a cardboard ax AS the WANDERER does this the 
TOWNSPEOPLE gather around the tree to cover its exit offstage 

TOWNSPERSON pointing to the farmer's cart Look at the farmer's Cart


TOWNSPERSON It is completely empty. What happened to all the pears

As everyone is looking at the cart the WANDERERS quickly and quietly exit the stage FARMER and CHILDREN gather around the empty cart 
They look very angry and ad-lib phrases such as 
how did this happen this is terrible now we won't get any money at the market


CHILD It was those Wanderers They were thieves 

CHILD Yes they stole our pears Where are those thieves


TOWNSPEOPLE several speak here They are gone The Wanderers are gone

 FARMER getting angry and stomping feet They can't be gone 
They stole our pears They stole our pears


TOWNSPERSON slowly with meaning What does it all mean 

TOWNSPERSON It means the greedy farmer and his her greedy children learned a 
big lesson today

All the TOWNS PEOPLE shake their heads yes and nod at one another and smile The FARMER and CHILDREN look glum and shake heads 
no as they walk dejectedly offstage with their empty cart

SCRIPT

As the play opens LION is at center stage and RHINOCEROS HIPPOPOTAMUS MOUSE GAZELLE and GIRAFFE are nearby RABBITS 
are sitting at side of stage lounging around


NARRATOR On a day when the jungle was hot and the animals were thirsty they all agreed they needed to dig a new well with fresh 
clean water 

LION Gather around animals We have a lot of work to do to dig this well 
Animals gather around LION to receive work 
instructions RABBITS ignore LION 

MOUSE We are ready to work Lion Big or small we can all do our part 
Animals begin the work of digging and 
moving dirt This can all be done through pantomime The animals can even form a line and pass the dirt to each other using toy buckets 
or pails as in an old-fashioned water bucket line for firefighting 

GIRAFFE looking toward RABBITS Rabbits Why aren't you helping


RABBIT acting superior We're much too busy for such silly unimportant work 

HIPPOPOTAMUS Silly unimportant work How can you say that


RHINOCEROS Yes we need water to live What could be more important

 RABBIT Do not bother us with such trivial things Besides we have to 
meet a friend
 RABBITS stand to leave and exit

 NARRATOR Finally the animals finished their hard work The new well was full of water 
enough for everyone
 Animals leave stage area Enter BIRD and RABBITS carrying berries 

BIRD I'm glad we were able to gather all these 
berries Should we eat a few 

RABBIT Let's eat a few and then we will put the rest in a special hiding place so we can share them later

RABBITS and BIRD pantomime burial of the berries and exit BIRD to one side and RABBITS to the other waving good-bye to each other 
BIRD leaves stage but RABBITS sneak back dig up and begin to eat the rest of the berries


RABBIT That silly bird Now we can finish off the rest of the berries ourselves 
RABBITS eat all the berries and pat their 
tummies to show how full they are Then one RABBIT has a sly plan

 NARRATOR After the Rabbits ate all the berries one of the Rabbits 
thought of a sly plan to trick Bird 

RABBIT Bird Bird
 BIRD reenters stage

 BIRD Yes What is it 

RABBIT 5 Look Bird All the berries are 
gone You must have taken them, since you knew where they were

 BIRD But Rabbit I did not take them Really I did not

 
RABBIT How are you going to pay us for them Give us your biggest and best feather

BIRD gives RABBIT a feather and then leaves stage shaking his head RABBITS laugh whisper and point at the outsmarted BIRD Enter 
DANCERS each holding ceremonial spears that can be made from wrapping paper rolls covered with colored papers and decorated 
with a few feathers or paper streamers


RABBIT Dancers would you like this feather to decorate your spear or clothing


DANCER Yes thank you


DANCER I will put it in my hair


DANCER Begin the drumbeat 
One DANCER begins beating a drum, which can simply be an old coffee can covered with construction paper 
DANCERS form a circle and begin to take a few steps together The DANCER wearing the feather removes it without drawing attention


RABBIT Hey where is our feather 
All DANCERS look around 

DANCER It's gone The wind must have blown it away


RABBIT What How are you going to pay us back 

DANCER Here Have this spear You can spear fish with it 
RABBIT takes the spear and the 
DANCERS exit RABBITS laugh and point at exiting DANCERS Enter FISHERS carrying pieces of net the kind used for luau decoration


FISHER My net has a big hole in it 

FISHER I am not quick enough to catch the fish with my hands


RABBIT Here use this spear

FISHER takes the spear and spears a fish made from construction paper with a circle of masking tape to which the spear 
will stick 

FISHER to other FISHERS Here take this fish to cook and eat 
FISHER takes fish and exits stage Meanwhile FISHER 
drops spear Other actors discreetly move it or kick it offstage


FISHER pointing no Look The spear is disappearing down the river
 FISHER reenters

 RABBIT 5 Where is our spear 
The remaining 
FISHERS look around but cannot find it

FISHER It is lost in the river 

RABBIT What How are you going to pay us back

FISHERS look at each other FISHER pulls out a bag of grain and gives it to RABBITS


FISHER Here is a bag of grain 
FISHERS exit ANTS bring anthill prop onto stage This can be a mound shape cut from a large piece of 
cardboard The ANTS locate themselves behind anthill prop RABBITS laugh and point at exiting FISHERS while this occurs 
RABBITS start to walk once anthill is in place The RABBIT carrying the bag of grain stumbles and drops the bag of grain down the anthill


RABBIT Anthill you took our bag of grain How are you going to pay us back
From behind the hill ANTS enter


ANT You can take us Rabbits


ANT The anthill sent us with thanks for the grain
 RABBITS take the ANTS by the arms and walk with them offstage Anthill is removed 
from stage Enter LION He sits guarding the well Reenter RABBITS with ANTS


RABBIT 3 to Lion We need some water Give us some water


LION You did not help us dig the well Rabbits You cannot have water 
RABBITS think for a minute


RABBIT Do you see what we have here Lion


LION What do you have 

RABBIT We have ants 
LION thinks for a few seconds 

LION I have an idea You tie me up and give me the ants 
Then you can drink


NARRATOR So the Rabbits tied Lion up very well and set the Ants down with him Then the Rabbits went to the well and 
drank When they were done drinking they took baths so that the well water was all dirty

As NARRATOR speaks RABBITS go to the well and pantomime drinking and washing activities


RABBIT to LION in a teasing way Well look at that The well water is all dirty Too bad


NARRATOR And so the Rabbits left. But soon after the animals came to drink and found their water all dirty

Enter ANIMALS RHINOCEROS HIPPOPOTAMUS GAZELLE GIRAFFE and MOUSE


MOUSE Lion you were supposed to guard the well How did it get so dirty

 LION it was the Rabbits Look They tied me up and tricked me 
into it by giving me these ants for a present

 RHINOCEROS We will teach those Rabbits a lesson they will not forget


GIRAFFE The Rabbits just cannot do these things Let's find them 
All the animals scurry about the stage and come back with RABBITS


GAZELLE Look what you did to our water Rabbits 

RABBIT looking So 

GAZELLE It's dirty It's no good for drinking 

RABBIT So

All the animals gather together in a line and look menacing and angry 

ANIMAL So this You can't trick us and ruin our water and 
get away with it anymore 

ANIMAL You have to leave this part of the jungle 

RABBIT We won't go This is our home too

 ANIMAL You will leave 
and you will leave now
 The animals start walking all together toward RABBITS perhaps in a menacing looking line RABBITS start to 
look around frightened all at once Then they turn and run away

 NARRATOR And so the animals chased the Rabbits out of their part of 
the jungle and the Rabbits never came back Everyone knows rabbits can be tricky and sly but sometimes the Lion has a few tricks 
of his her own

 HAWK 
SUN RULER


SCRIPT

As the play begins all actors except SUN RULER are on stage They sit or stand randomly as if in the midst of an important meeting


BIRD I tell you I'm tired of all this arguing and bickering


BIRD We never get anything decided It's always complain complain complain


BIRD I know Perhaps if we had a special ruler he she could resolve some of our disagreements


BIRD Yes but since we never agree on anything how will we agree on who should be our ruler

All the BIRDS shake heads and nod


BIRD getting an idea I know We could ask the great Sun Ruler He she can decide


BIRD I have an idea All those birds who want to be our ruler can try to fly to the sun


BIRD That's a good idea The sun is far away and only the strongest and bravest bird would make it


BIRD And if more than one bird makes it the Sun Ruler can choose among them


BIRD Now that is one great idea that we can all agree upon Surely any bird who makes the long hot flight to the sun will make a good ruler


BIRD When shall the contest begin


BIRD walking to one part of the stage and pointing Let all the birds who want to try to be our ruler gather here


BIRDS and remain in their places All other BIRDS including HAWK EAGLE and CONDOR gather in the designated part of the stage to 
get ready for the flight As a humorous touch have the birds strut stretch and do short jogs as 
runners do before a big race As they do this birds should try to look cocky and a little smug The sun prop which can be a fancy 
chair decorated in yellow orange and gold paper is brought on the stage at a location far from the 
BIRDS or toward the back of the stage as space permits


BIRD All right Are all you birds ready yet


COMPETING BIRDS all nodding yes and ad-libbing these types of responses Yes yes yes Let's go We're ready Let's do it now Up up and away


BIRD Okay At the sound of the bell the race will begin The first bird to reach the sun will be our bird ruler


BIRD And if more than one of you arrives together the Sun Ruler will decide who will rule us


BIRD ringing bell as he she says go On your mark Get set Go


Alternatively use a whistle instead of a bell and change the BIRD script line appropriately


The BIRDS begin flying around the stage in a random way After a few moments several BIRDS start to tire and fall to the ground When 
BIRDS fall they should go to the side of the stage and collapse there looking very tired


BIRD I'm so small I'm getting very tired


BIRD Me too I guess I'm too weak to be ruler I I can't go on


BIRD I'm falling too I I can't do it The sun is too far 
BIRDS and fall The rest of the BIRDS continue to fly a bit longer 
Then they resume dialogue

 BIRD I've tried and tried but I can't make it 

BIRD Me neither But look Eagle Hawk and Condor continue to soar


BIRD Well I admit it They are stronger than I am

 BIRD And braver than I am I'm out 
BIRDS and collapse to the side of main action 
EAGLE HAWK CONDOR and BIRDS continue 

BIRD Eagle how do you keep going I'm getting weaker and weaker


EAGLE I just fly. I beat my wings and soar

 BIRD You Hawk and Condor you are stronger than me I'm falling falling

BIRDS and any others who are still flying collapse leaving only EAGLE HAWK and CONDOR who continue flying

 HAWK Condor Eagle only we 
three are left 
The three actors circle the stage in their soaring movement 

BIRD pointing Look only three birds are left


BIRD Yes they are all the great strong birds the Eagle the Hawk and the Condor 

BIRD I wonder if they will all make it The sun is 
still far away
 BIRDS continue flying movement for a few seconds before they begin to speak

 HAWK no I was sure I could make it 
but I thought we would be to the sun by now 

EAGLE It's getting hotter and hotter and still the sun is a long way off 


CONDOR Do not talk Just fly Let the wind power your wings 

HAWK I can't I have no more strength I can't make it

 EAGLE The sun is 
too hot I'm faint I feel myself falling 
EAGLE and HAWK begin to falter and fall As they sit other birds come to help them while 
CONDOR reaches the sun

 CONDOR I am here I have reached the Sun Ruler's palace 
SUN RULER enters coming to center stage 


SUN RULER Condor why do you come


CONDOR Sun Ruler the birds of the Andes could not choose a leader We decided that the bird who reached you could be leader 
but I leave the final decision to you

 SUN RULER Condor you are strong and brave From the sun I rule the Earth but you can help me 
You shall rule all the birds of the Andes and your home shall be the highest mountain tops


BIRDS all together begin cheering and clapping and simultaneously saying lines such as those listed below  for the new leader 
The brave condor our bird ruler Hail to the condor CONDOR leaves the sun and walks toward BIRDS 

BIRD You have proven your bravery


BIRD You have proven your strength


BIRD You are worthy to be our ruler

 BIRDS all together Hail to Condor Leader of us all Ruler of the Highest Andes

All the DUENDES sneak out from offstage 
areas and begin looking about They are searching for something and seem to be puzzled


DUENDE I can't find anything 

DUENDE Neither can I Not a crumb or a scrap remains 

DUENDE You would think such a fine family 
as ours could leave us just a little something to eat


DUENDE Yes a crust of bread or a crumb of cake would be nice 

DUENDE They are not very thoughtful 

DUENDE No they are not How can we let 
them know that they are forgetting us 

DUENDE I know We can play a little trick

 DUENDE Yes then they will know we were here


DUENDE But what shall we do 
The DUENDES scratch their heads and think They may whisper to each other and shake heads yes or no


DUENDE I have an idea Let's turn the chairs upside down Then they will know we were here 

DUENDE Then they will remember to think about us

One or two DUENDES turn chairs over Then the DUENDES survey the scene smile and shake heads yes and sneak offstage When they are gone the 
family returns

trouble neighbor

 FRIEND You look upset Did something happen 

MOTHER Look The chairs are turned over

there Some people call them the duendes 

FATHER Duendes I have never heard of them

 NARRATOR The family's friends left and the family talked 
over what had happened The family had a busy day and began their usual before-bedtime cleaning routine

in perfect order Not a scrap or a crumb had been left behind 
DUENDES sneak out from offstage areas again and begin searching 
for crumbs and scraps

 DUENDE I can't find anything

 DUENDE Neither can I Not a crumb or a scrap remains 

DUENDE You would think such a 
fine family as ours could leave us just a little something to eat 

DUENDE Yes a crust of bread or a crumb of cake would be nice


DUENDE They are not very thoughtful 

DUENDE No they are not How can we let them know that they are forgetting us 


DUENDE Perhaps another trick is what we need 

DUENDE Yes with a second trick they will be sure not to forget us 

DUENDE 
But what shall we do

DUENDES scratch their heads and think They whisper to each other and shake heads


DUENDE I have an idea Let's take the chairs away this time and hide them


DUENDE Yes then they will remember to think about us
 Several DUENDES remove the chairs Then the DUENDES sneak offstage When they are 
gone the family returns 

CHILD What happened here

 CHILD Who did this 

CHILDREN refusing blame by ad-libbing these types of responses 
I didn't do it it wasn't me not me
 FRIENDS enter stage as though dropping in for a visit 

FRIEND What's the trouble neighbor What happened 


FATHER Look Our chairs are gone Do you think it was the duendes 

FRIEND Well it might be I have heard they do this kind of thing 


FRIEND Do you know why they might want to trick you

 FRIEND Do you leave anything out for them to snack on in the evening 
while you sleep


CHILD No we clean everything perfectly

 CHILD Not even one crumb remains when we finish cleaning


GRANDMOTHER Perhaps that is the answer perhaps we can make peace with our duendes


CHILD We can leave them a slice of cake each night


CHILD And a drink of cool water Sharing with them should make for a good peace


NARRATOR And that is exactly what the family did Each night they left out a treat or a snack but they cleaned every other scrap and crumb 
The duendes were happy and the family was happy too

SCRIPT


When the play opens LEPRECHAUNS are situated in one part of the stage They are engaged in a variety of activities from making 
music with cardboard fiddle shapes pipes and drums to repairing shoes with small toy wood hammers CHILDREN enter from different 
parts of the stage At first they do not see the LEPRECHAUNS As the NARRATOR begins to speak there is the sound of Irish 
music and tapping in the background Check your local library for cassettes of Irish music


NARRATOR One day a group of children went for a walk in the Irish countryside Their families were poor farmers and the year's crops 
had not been good They had little but they shared what they had 
CHILDREN are walking when one stops suddenly to listen to something and 
then the others stop to listen as well

 CHILD I hear music 

CHILD I hear tapping 

CHILD No no I think it's music


CHILD pointing in the direction of the LEPRECHAUNS It's coming from over there 

CHILD Let's go find out what it is

 CHILD excitedly Go 
quietly though It may be leprechauns 

CHILD If we can find them before they see us perhaps we can make them give us their gold

CHILDREN tiptoe quietly to area where LEPRECHAUNS are at work and play As they tiptoe the Irish music is louder As CHILDREN near 
the spot where LEPRECHAUNS are they speak 

CHILD Look There are the leprechauns There are so many of them 

CHILD Surely this is our lucky day


CHILD But remember once we see them we must never take our eyes off them If we do they will trick us and we will lose them before they 
take us to the gold 
CHILDREN split up so that they surround LEPRECHAUNS before they speak


CHILD Leprechauns you are captured 

CHILD Don't blink or take your eyes off them


CHILD Leprechauns you must take us to your pot of gold


LEPRECHAUN pretending to be afraid perhaps winking at a fellow LEPRECHAUN I guess these children have us in their clutches after all


LEPRECHAUN dramatically pretending overwhelming fear What shall we do


LEPRECHAUN We have no choice We must take them to our gold


CHILDREN confident Yes That's right You must take us to the gold


LEPRECHAUN putting hand to ear as though hearing something in the distance We should start for the gold now But wait 
Children I think I hear your parents calling for you


CHILD You cannot trick us that easily Leprechaun I still have my eyes on you all Take us to the gold


LEPRECHAUN Yes you are clever children Well we must be on our way

Suddenly LEPRECHAUN 5 stops and cries out in fear


LEPRECHAUN pointing But wait children look over there There is a huge snake coming at us


CHILD You cannot trick us Leprechaun There are no snakes in Ireland Take us to the gold

At this point LEPRECHAUNS shake heads shrug shoulders and start leading the CHILDREN around and off the stage to the sound of Irish music 
Those LEPRECHAUNS with instrument props can pretend to play to the prerecorded music you use

While they are offstage on their walk to find the gold two students unroll or uncover a large painted scene of clovers LEPRECHAUNS and 
CHILDREN break into two groups on their way to the gold One group reenters and encounters WANDERERS as they enter the stage 
The WANDERERS are tired hungry and poor


WANDERER Hello children How are you


CHILD You all look very tired and hungry


WANDERER Yes we are tired and hungry


WANDERER We are farmers but out crops did not do well this year


WANDERER We don't know what we shall do The future looks bleak


CHILD YOU can come with us We captured the leprechauns and they are taking us to their gold


WANDERER how kind you children are


WANDERER Thank you for sharing with us Will there be enough


CHILD Of course there will be enough Come with us

The other group of CHILDREN and LEPRECHAUNS reenter stage and meet up at another spot on stage with WANDERERS 
who are also tired and hungry.


WANDERER Hello children How are you


CHILD You all look very tired and hungry


WANDERER Yes we are tired and hungry


WANDERER We are farmers but our crops did not do well this year


WANDERER We don't know what we shall do The future looks bleak


CHILD You can come with us We captured the leprechauns and they are taking us to their gold


WANDERER how kind you children are


WANDERER Thank you for sharing with us Will there be enough 

CHILD Of course there will be enough Come with us

The LEPRECHAUNS of each group lead the CHILDREN and WANDERERS a few steps further so they reach the scenery of the field of clovers


LEPRECHAUN Well here we are The gold is here in this field


CHILDREN in unison But where in this field


WANDERER The field goes on forever


WANDERER How can the children ever find the gold in there


WANDERER You leprechauns are trying to trick the children again


LEPRECHAUN pointing to a particular clover plant No it is no trick The gold is right there under that clover plant


LEPRECHAUN But you will need shovels to dig for it because it is very deep


LEPRECHAUN And you will need bags to carry it home because there is a lot of gold there


WANDERER Children this is a trick if you leave now you will never be able to remember which clover plant the gold is under


CHILDREN all say together What will we do


WANDERER I know Have the leprechauns tie a red ribbon around the clover plant that has the gold buried under it


WANDERER Yes that is a good idea

WANDERER has a red paper ribbon with a circle of masking tape on back for this next part of the play 
The red ribbon can be pressed onto the scenery to mark the special clover plant


WANDERER holding out a red paper ribbon Here is a ribbon that you


LEPRECHAUN taking ribbon and pressing it onto painted clover We can do that I am tying the ribbon on now The rest of you children and 
farmers must go get bags and shovels


All the CHILDREN and WANDERERS move offstage quickly except CHILD who hides While the others are gone the LEPRECHAUNS get 
many more paper red ribbons and cover all the clover plants with red ribbons When this is done the LEPRECHAUNS 
leave and the others return to the stage with bags and shovels or hand spades


CHILDREN AND WANDERERS in unison no The leprechauns outsmarted us after all


CHILD We cannot dig up the whole hill We are lost


CHILD coming out of hiding No we aren't I stayed behind and marked the special clover plant It is this one Pointing to the first plant 
on which a ribbon was placed Dig here

CHILDREN pantomime digging and finding gold and passing it around to share with all


NARRATOR And that is how the children of Ireland outsmarted the leprechauns after all

How the Elephant Sees It


PLAYERS 
ELEPHANTS 
MICE 
SNAKES 
ANTS 
BATS 
SPIDERS 

SCRIPT

As the play begins the ELEPHANTS are sitting and standing around the stage feeling very sad With them are the MICE and they are 
talking together


Optional introduction can be read by teacher or a student People often misunderstand nature's creatures who live near them 
The elephant for example is a large animal but eats only plants It does not fight unless it is in danger Sometimes
 when the elephant looks for food it mistakes people's crops for wild grasses This makes people angry Other animals
 such as bats are thought of as pests too Bats are very important to all of us wherever they live because they keep insect 
populations in control Enjoy our play about the important role all creatures play in nature's web of life


ELEPHANT with confusion and concern You know we may be big but we only eat plants Why do people keep saying bad things about us 
They say we step on their crops and ruin their houses


ELEPHANT We can't help it Often they plant their crops where we live We don't mean to step on their houses On the other hand when people 
come after us to get our tusks they do mean to hurt us


MOUSE Look Elephants I hate to see you let these things get you down People have never understood us animals


MOUSE Yeah They don't understand how we work together They just don't see that we each have an important job to do no matter who we are

As the play opens all the different groups of flowers are standing or sitting on stage steps or risers as your stage allows 
CHILDREN enter


CHILD This is a wonderful garden Look at all the beautiful flowers


CHILD Wouldn't it be wonderful if the flowers could talk like they do in Alice in Wonderland


CHILD Flowers only talk in books This is real life

FLOWERS snicker and laugh quietly Then they all say next line loudly in unison


ALL FLOWERS loudly in unison This is real life too


CHILD Who said that What's going on here


FLOWER We said it The flowers This is a magic garden


FLOWER The flowers that bloom here are so beautiful that we inspired the greatest poets of history to write about us


FLOWER One of the most famous of all writers wrote about us


CHILD And who was that


FLOWER That was Mr. William Shakespeare


FLOWER Would you like to hear what we can do


CHILD Yes please We would love to


FLOWER Roses would you like to go first


ROSE We'd be glad to


ROSE You may have heard these lines before


ROSE They remind us of our wonderful fragrance


ALL ROSES in unison be some other name What's in a name That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet


ROSE Mr. Shakespeare wrote those lines for his play Romeo and Juliet


FLOWER Would you like to hear another poem from Mr. Shakespeare


CHILDREN in unison yes


FLOWER Daisies violets Are you ready


DAISY We are ready


ALL DAISIES AND VIOLETS in unison Daisies and violets blue and lady-smocks of silver-white and cuckoo-buds of yellow hue 
do paint the meadows with delight


VIOLET That poem was from another one of Mr. Shakespeare's plays called Love's Labours Lost


DAFFODIL Mr. Shakespeare wrote about other flowers too like us daffodils


DAFFODIL In his play A Winter's Tale he wrote about our blooming in spring


DAFFODIL Yes he said we bring the sweet time of the year


DAFFODIL This is how he said it


ALL DAFFODILS When daffodils begin to peer then comes in the sweet the year


CHILD Well this has been the most amazing visit to a flower garden I have ever had


CHILD It's been wonderful Do you know any other poems

In this next part of the play actors will read or recite either other famous poems written for children about flowers or 
preferably poems the students have written themselves The line which CHILD says below should reflect which category of poems 
will be used in the next section


CHILD Do you know any poems by children like us Do you know any poems written for children like us


FLOWER I think we do Let's try a few Insert here some recitations by small groups of flowers Preferably the poems will be couplets 
haiku or other short poems the students write themselves If your children are young the poems recited here can be those written by 
class effort In the alternative you can use poems from children's poetry collections that were written for children See the Perform 
It section on for some examples


CHILD You know those poems sounded like the poems we wrote learned in class last week


CHILD Yes they do How do you flowers know our flower poems FLOWERS giggle and whisper


CHILD I guess you really are a magic garden


FLOWERS in unison Yes a magic garden of flowers and verse

As the play opens the PAINTS PAINTBRUSHES and PALETTE are center back of stage They freeze On stage on the floor near them for 
easy access are three large posterboards each painted differently One is drip splatter painted in the Jackson Pollock style one is 
cubist in the Pablo Picasso Georges Braque style and one is painted with strong twisted strokes in the Vincent Van Gogh style 
Students with drawing paper and pencils are located randomly around them They are sketching and talking quietly Enter TEACHER


TEACHER Now Students take out your brushes and paints It's time to do our weekly art project


STUDENT I hate art My picture is never as good as everyone else's


STUDENT I know what you mean I see something in my head but my picture never looks like what I see


STUDENT That's how I feel too My picture is never quite right


STUDENT How can you say that You are a really good artist


STUDENT Yeah you're the best artist in our class


STUDENT Well that doesn't mean that I like everything I do

The PAINTBRUSHES have been listening as the STUDENTS speak Now they wake up to give the STUDENTS a little advice and counsel


PAINTBRUSH clearing throat and speaking with authority I think you students are a bit confused

STUDENTS look around surprised


PAINTBRUSH Yes there isn't just one kind of painting that is good


PAINTBRUSH Each person is an artist and you each have your own style


STUDENT Yeah and my style is bad


RED PAINT Why do you think your style is bad


STUDENT No matter how hard I try my pictures are messy with spots all over them


STUDENT Mine too


BLUE PAINT Spots all over them You mean a little like this BLUE PAINT goes behind a posterboard canvas held up by two other 
PAINT actors and pretends to paint vigorously to the sound of some exciting excerpt of music BLUE PAINT then turns the picture 
around and it is a drip splatter painting in the style of Jackson Pollock


STUDENT Wow that's exactly how my pictures look


YELLOW PAINT Well then you are in good company because this painting is like the work of a famous twentieth century painter named 
Jackson Pollock


STUDENTS Wow


STUDENT Well that's fine for you guys but my pictures look strange


STUDENT Mine too My faces seem sort of and odd They look a little like a math paper on shapes


ORANGE PAINT thoughtfully tapping chin Shapes  Math Sounds like geometry to me Let me try something 
ORANGE PAINT goes to posterboard 
canvas held up by two PAINT actors and begins to work furiously When the canvas turns a cubist-style painting is displayed


GREEN PAINT Does your artwork look anything like this


STUDENT Yes that's right Doesn't that look a little strange to you


PURPLE PAINT What looks strange to one person looks wonderful and exciting to another

BLACK PAINT Yes a very famous artist named 
Pablo Picasso invented a style of painting like this It is called cubism


STUDENT Someone got famous for painting faces that look like a math paper


PALETTE Some people thought they looked strange but lots more people thought they looked exciting and interesting


WHITE PAINT Picasso was always trying different styles and methods


BLUE PAINT importantly Yes that's true Of course his best period was that well-known period called his blue period Pause Optional
such a great period of art


GREEN PAINT acting superior but with a joking tone brother How you do go on


BLUE PAINT You're just green with envy That's your problem

GREEN PAINT crosses arms as if in a huff


STUDENT But wait What is a blue period anyway 

STUDENT I learned about that in a book I have in his blue period Picasso painted 
many pictures all in shades of blue


STUDENT Now that's a style I can get into I always seem to start painting with a color and use that same color all over 
the place in the picture


STUDENT acting superior Monotonous That's what I call it


BLUE PAINT dreamily Inspired That's what I call it


PALETTE You see Students people always have different opinions about art It doesn't mean it's good or it's bad It's just different


STUDENT Well none of this helps me My artwork always looks rough and really bright and all twisted up


RED PAINT Rough 

WHITE PAINT Bright YELLOW PAINT And maybe all twisted up 

PAINTBRUSH Sounds like one of history's most famous painters


PAINTBRUSH Yep that sounds just like the work of Vincent Van Gogh Optional Lines He's probably one of the most famous artists who ever
lived but when he was alive nobody bought his paintings because they thought they were too strange 
PAINTBRUSH goes behind a posterboard 
canvas held up by two PAINT actors and works furiously to music The work is turned around and is in the style of Van Gogh with 
twisting strokes and strong colors 

STUDENT My art looks a little like that too

 STUDENT I guess I see what you're saying Art can be many 
different things and look many different ways 

STUDENT Yes there are many different styles of art and different people like different styles


BLACK PAINT Art is a way of expressing yourself your feelings and ideas


WHITE PAINT Art is not about good or bad It's about saying something with a paintbrush and a box of paints


STUDENT 14 Well I think we all have plenty to say


TEACHER That's certainly never been a problem before Why don't you all say something with your paintbrushes right now
 
STUDENT in our 
own personal styles


STUDENT Not good or bad


STUDENT Not right or wrong


TEACHER No rights or wrongs goods or bads Each of you is an artist You paint it in your own style

As the play opens STUDENTS are milling about waiting for the start of a field trip You might have one child hold up a sign that reads 
Museum Lobby


STUDENT Boring Here we are on another field trip to a museum


STUDENT We only get one trip a year and it's always to some museum with a lot of old stuff in it


STUDENT Yeah and today we're going to look at statues Statues are just a bunch of funny-shaped rocks Like you said boring

STUDENT pointing to entering actors Look Here comes the Teacher with the Tour Guides now

TEACHER TOUR GUIDES and TOUR CHIEF enter


TEACHER Today we are going on a tour of the sculpture gallery We will all meet back here later Now let's line up

STUDENTS get into lines near their designated TOUR GUIDES At this point the TOUR CHIEF claps his or her hands to get everyone's attention


TOUR CHIEF I'm the head of the Tour Department Welcome to our museum I want to tell you about our wonderful new information stations


TEACHER Yes At each sculpture you see there will be an information station To hear the information just push the red button


TOUR CHIEF Enjoy your tours.
All actors leave stage When stage is empty the statue THE THINKER enters with the RODIN INFORMATION STATION 
The INFORMATION STATION is a student who carries a sign that says Rodin Information Station under which is a six-inch red circle 
THE THINKER goes to center stage and assumes the pose of the famous statue and the INFORMATION STATION stands to one side 
When these actors are in place TOUR GUIDE enters with STUDENTS 

TOUR GUIDE All right children here we are at our first statue today Who 
would like to push the red button

Several STUDENTS raise hands and TOUR GUIDE chooses one who walks up pushes the button and returns to place with other STUDENTS In 
response to the STUDENT touching the red circle on the poster the RODIN INFORMATION STATION begins to speak in a robotic or 
computerized sounding voice


RODIN INFORMATION STATION sounding robotic This statue is called The Thinker It was made by sculptor Auguste Rodin Rodin was born in 
France in 

TOUR GUIDE Now children what do you suppose The Thinker is doing


STUDENT sounding bored Thinking of course


STUDENT Of course he's thinking The question is pausing and really pondering what is he thinking about


STUDENT You know this could be more interesting than I thought it would be What is he thinking about


STUDENTS Each STUDENT makes his or her own guess about what the statue model is thinking Children can simply start their statements 
by saying I think The Thinker was thinking about


STUDENT Boy this is fun after all It's like trying to find out a secret and only the statue knows the answer


TOUR GUIDE Well you all did a great job Now we must move on to the next part of the museum

TOUR GUIDE and STUDENTS exit THE DANCER and DEGAS INFORMATION STATION enter and take center stage DANCER strikes a pose like an actual 
Degas statue When they are in place TOUR GUIDE and STUDENTS enter and place themselves around the statue so that it is still visible 
to the audience


TOUR GUIDE Who wants to push the red button

Several children raise hands and TOUR GUIDE picks one CHILD walks up and pushes red button and returns to place with other children


DEGAS INFORMATION STATION sounding robotic This statue is called The Dancer It was made by Edgar Degas Degas was born in France in


TOUR GUIDE Now what kind of dance do you think the dancer is doing


STUDENT Well it's not hip hop


STUDENT And it's not the twist


STUDENT And it's definitely not the hokey pokey


STUDENT you guys It's ballet of course But I wonder what ballet she is dancing


STUDENTS These children can make up their own lines about what ballet she might be dancing For the children to do this effectively 
they need to have heard parts of several ballets as part of class curriculum related to this play production Sample 
statements might be

 We studied Aaron Copland's Billy the Kid in school but she doesn't look like she's doing a rodeo dance

And I've heard of Peter Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake but she doesn't look like a swan

Well I think she's doing the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy and I'm getting hungry enough to eat a sugar plum right now whatever that is


TOUR GUIDE Well those are all good answers but now it's time to move on

TOUR GUIDE and STUDENTS exit THE DANCER and DEGAS INFORMATION STATION exit Enter NEVELSON INFORMATION STATION and students bring in 
boxes that make up Nevelson's sculpture objects glued into boxes At this point TOUR GUIDE TEACHER and STUDENTS enter


STUDENT Wow what is this This is a lot different from the other sculptures we saw


TOUR GUIDE Who would like to push the button and find out more about this artwork

Several STUDENTS raise hands, and TOUR GUIDE 3 chooses one

That STUDENT walks up pushes red button and returns to group of students


NEVELSON INFORMATION STATION sounding robotic This sculpture is by Louise Nevelson She created a series of artworks like these in 
which different objects were placed in box shapes

She was an American artist born in 

STUDENT But what is this sculpture about


TEACHER What do you think it is about I don't have any magic answers Tell me what you think


STUDENTS Students who should have previously studied and discussed the art-in-a-box of Ms. Nevelson can give their ideas about why 
Ms. Nevelson created these artworks and what she was trying to say They make their statements one after another


STUDENT Are any of those the right answer


TOUR GUIDE There really is no wrong answer Art means different things to different people


STUDENT I like this I wish there were really no wrong answers on tests at school


STUDENT These statues seem sort of like puzzles waiting to be solved by us


TOUR GUIDE That's a great way to look at art as a puzzle to be solved but now it's time to return to your group


TOUR GUIDE and STUDENTS exit as well as NEVELSON INFORMATION STATION The Nevelson sculpture is also removed.

As tour groups with GUIDES and TEACHER reenter the stage one student can hold up the Museum Lobby sign again TOUR CHIEF 
enters stage from another direction at about the same time


TOUR CHIEF Well children what did you think of your tour


STUDENT It was much more interesting than I thought it would be


STUDENT It's really fun to look at a statue and try to figure out why the artist decided to make it


STUDENT It's a little like solving a mystery


STUDENT That's true This field trip was pretty interesting but there's something that remains a mystery to me


TEACHER What's that


STUDENT When are we going to lunch I'm starving


TEACHER Where should we go


STUDENTS STUDENTS can insert a restaurant that is interesting and appropriate and then all shout it together while 
TOUR GUIDES and TOUR CHIEF shake their heads smiling or put hands over their ears Examples of what can be called out are pizza or 
hamburger chains or local restaurants that are familiar and well-liked by children


TEACHER sarcastically shaking head and smiling Now that's what I call culture

SCRIPT
As the play opens six SCIENTISTS are at center stage discussing something among themselves The children are seated in 
two groups on stairs or risers or in the alternative can enter and exit stage if there are no steps or risers

About half the children stand for each presentation At the end all are standing The plot device is that the scientists of the ages are 
looking down at Earth They are worried about whether anyone is interested in science anymore As the scientists speak to each other 
they can insert reference to each other's names For example SCIENTIST below could say No no no Professor Einstein if you choose 
Einstein as one of your six scientists


SCIENTIST No no no It's very sad Children just do not care about science these days




SCIENTIST It's true They are too busy with sports and television and movies to think about science




SCIENTIST I'm not sure you are right Insert scientist's name and I have been looking at Earth lately in our travels and we 
think science is alive and well




SCIENTIST You think so Then I suggest insert name of scientist that you prove your hypothesis


SCIENTIST We will Let's see Here comes a group of students now Let's see what they think about science STUDENTS and STUDENTS 
either stand in their places or if previously offstage enter now




SCIENTIST Students we are having a disagreement about whether children today are interested in science Can you help us


SCIENTIST Yes can you tell us what you have been learning about science and if you like it



STUDENT Yes this year we learned all about insert student written statement of scientific subject




STUDENTS These students present posters and say a line or two about what they learned in the subject stated by STUDENT 

SCIENTIST 
Yes that's very interesting but it only proves that you had to study science in school




STUDENT But I was so interested I checked out a library book and did some experiments at home




STUDENT And I went to our local museum to see a special exhibit




STUDENT I went to the bookstore and bought a book about the subject that interested me most


STUDENT We like studying science You can get your hands dirty with experiments and all


STUDENT Yeah it's as good as art class where you can also get really messy


STUDENTS and STUDENTS sit or exit as appropriate


SCIENTIST You see what we mean Kids do like science


SCIENTIST I don't know That's just one group of kids


SCIENTIST Well here comes another group Let's hear what they have to say


STUDENTS and STUDENTS stand or enter


SCIENTIST Students can you tell us something We want to know if children today are interested in science


STUDENT yes We were just talking about what we've been learning


STUDENTS STUDENTS make their brief presentations on what they have been studying


STUDENT We thought what we learned was so interesting we would go find out more at the library


STUDENTS reenter together with STUDENTS 

SCIENTIST Well thank you You all have convinced me




SCIENTISTS AND in unison and us


SCIENTIST Children today are still interested in science


SCIENTIST What other scientific subjects do you children want to investigate

All students stand at this time if not already standing


STUDENT I want to learn about inserts the subject he or she wants to learn more about


STUDENTS Take turns stating the scientific subjects they want to learn more about


SCIENTIST Well this is great Science is alive and well for children on Earth


STUDENT Well we can't say it about the whole Earth and all the kids on it but


STUDENTS all together Science is alive and well at insert name of school

CLOUDS 
RAINDROPS 


SCRIPT



STUDENTS gather round one part of the stage as though looking through the classroom window at the rain outside
 

STUDENT Wow Look at that rain come down


STUDENT sadly I guess this means we can't go out for recess


STUDENT It's so amazing The sky changes from blue to gray and then all of a sudden water falls out of it


STUDENT Yeah it almost seems like magic to me


TEACHER It's not magic It's more like geometry


STUDENT Magic or geometry It's all the same to me It means we can't go out to recess


STUDENT stop complaining I don't understand insert teacher's name How can rain be like geometry


STUDENT Yeah geometry is about shapes like squares and circles



TEACHER jumping in as STUDENT speaks That's what I mean Think about a circle What could be a bigger circle than the water cycle circle


STUDENT Well I don't get it



STUDENT Me neither 

STUDENTS are talking among themselves They seem to come up with an idea 

STUDENT Wait a minute We think we know what 
you mean



 STUDENT pointing toward center stage Yes Does the rain circle go something like this

 Enter RAINDROPS 

STUDENT First raindrops 
come down something like this

 RAINDROPS Plinking tinkling Raindrops sprinkling 

RAINDROPS Plopping splashing Raindrops crashing

 
RAINDROPS slowly Rain water falls in a lake or an ocean to start a process called evaporation


As RAINDROPS finish lines they imitate drops falling and go to seated positions at side of stage or they can exit



STUDENT That's all fine but I don't see how it's a circle It seems more like a straight line




STUDENT and what's evaporation anyway


TEACHER Wait children let your friends finish their story


CLOUDS enter

 STUDENT Pointing to entering CLOUDS So water falls to Earth as rain or snow and then something like this happens


CLOUDS The sun warms the water so it changes shape or you could just say that it turns to a gas called water vapor


CLOUDS as vapor the water goes up to the sky and cools into clouds that go drifting by


CLOUDS but that's not the end of this circular tale There's more to come so listen well


CLOUDS remain in place on stage RAINDROPS enter and stand behind some of the individual CLOUDS



STUDENT with anger Rain clouds evaporation vapor circles What's really important here is that we won't get to go out for recess


TEACHER Now let's be patient just a few minutes more


STUDENT I'm sorry but I still don't see how rain is like a circle


STUDENT Okay it's time to close the circle You saw the rain come down right


STUDENTS Right


STUDENT and you saw the rain evaporate up into the air and condense into clouds right


STUDENTS Right


STUDENT Well as the water vapor in the clouds gets cooler and the clouds get heavier and heavier something like this happens


CLOUDS hold arms out in a curved fashion and bend knees a little so they look like they are getting heavier and heavier 
Then from behind the CLOUDS RAINDROPS come out to say their lines



RAINDROPS as the water vapor in the clouds cools more the clouds get heavy with a watery store



RAINDROPS and soon the clouds are so heavy they burst with a storm or shower that feeds the Earth's thirst




CLOUDS AND RAINDROPS together So the water on Earth goes round and round a more circular story could hardly be found




STUDENT So insert teacher's name isn't that how rain is like a circle


TEACHER It Certainly is


STUDENT but you can also think about rain as a very hard worker


STUDENT Yes it makes plants grow so we can have food Without water not one living thing on Earth could survive


STUDENT Look it's stopped raining


STUDENT I'm glad the rain stopped working for a while Can we go out to recess now and play


TEACHER While the rain was working outside you all were working inside on this great water cycle lesson I think you've earned your 
recess today Class dismissed

SCRIPT



CHILDREN stand or sit around the stage as the play opens Each is holding a different object The objects can be any tools or toys that 
they choose the objects are examples of the technology they are discussing as the play opens



CHILD Isn't technology great All these things we have help us in so many ways




CHILD And we take so many of them for granted like our cars and bikes Even things like spoons and toothbrushes


CHILD standing and looking confused Spoons and cars I don't understand What are you talking about What exactly is technology


CHILD Technology is really almost anything that people make to help them do a job it means taking really simple things and putting 
them together to make other things


CHILD But it's the simple things too




CHILD Like what


CHILD Well like the six simple machines of ancient times


CHILD What are those 
Enter WHEEL & AXLE


CHILD pointing at the entering WHEEL & AXLE One is the wheel and axle Look at all it does for us


WHEEL & AXLE I roll everywhere for people I roll real cars and toy cars I roll dollies that carry big loads and I work and work and 
work inside all kinds of machines


WHEEL & AXLE remains on stage but moves to side 

CHILD Wow I hardly ever think about how important a wheel on an axle is


Enter PULLEY

 CHILD pointing to entering PULLEY and then there is the pulley Look at what it does


PULLEY I work all around you helping to lift and move things You use me to raise a flag and to open and close curtains 
Look around and you'll see me hard at work


PULLEY remains on stage but moves to side Enter INCLINED PLANE



CHILD pointing to entering INCLINED PLANE and there is the inclined plane Look at how it helps us


INCLINED PLANE I don't say much but I'm all around too I help you move things from low places to high places Look for me 
in delivery ramps and wheelchair ramps


INCLINED PLANE moves to side of stage Enter LEVER


CHILD pointing to entering LEVER Don't forget the lever Remember how Atlas moved the Earth


LEVER If you want to lift up a heavy box to put something under it you might use me


LEVER moves to side of stage Enter WEDGE


CHILD pointing to entering WEDGE and what about the wedge It helps you lift many things


WEDGE Yes my narrow side goes where others cannot fit and then quietly so quietly I help lift the impossible


WEDGE moves to side of stage SCREW enters




CHILD pointing to entering SCREW and finally there is the trusty screw I couldn't possibly count all the places you can find a screw 
hard at work

 SCREW I'm your best friend for holding things together I am much better at that job than a simple nail 

SCREW moves to side 
of stage

 CHILD Wow and all those simple things are part of technology 

CHILD Yes and when you put them together you can make big 
big machines 

CHILD Let's build a big machine

The six SIMPLE MACHINES now exit stage



CHILD How should we do that


CHILDREN discuss this question among themselves


CHILD Well maybe we could all bring spare parts from our garages and junk drawers at home


CHILD That's fine but what would our machine do


CHILDREN discuss this question among themselves




CHILD I've got an idea about the kind of machine we can make Let's get to work
CHILDREN bring in the MACHINE PARTS and line them up The CHILDREN now create a moving machine by bringing each of the MACHINE 
PARTS to the center of the stage one at a time This is a pantomime activity for the MACHINE PARTS The first one is placed in 
center stage and begins a movement Then the CHILDREN bring the rest of the MACHINE PARTS one at a time but each new part 
must connect in some way with one of the other parts on stage hand on another actor's shoulder MACHINE PARTS can sit or stand or kneel 
The movement they choose to make must be repeated over and over again until this part of the scene is over One of the 
CHILDREN places a posterboard sign flat on the ground at the end of this human machine line


CHILD Our machine is working great


CHILD Yes but what does it do What's the point of technology if it doesn't produce something useful


CHILD picking up a piece of posterboard that says 

The End on one side and hiding that side from the audience but it does produce something useful




CHILD Look It worked It made a sign


CHILD We made a sign-making machine



CHILD A sign-making machine That's interesting but what does the sign say




CHILD It's a very useful sign and I can use it right now


as 
CHILD says this he or she walks to center stage and holds up the sign that says 

The End At this point you can end your play or you can use the short segment 
below to allow each student in your class to have at least one speaking line To continue the play CHILDREN 
exit stage and MACHINE PARTS remain SIMPLE MACHINES reenter and stand to the sides of the stage   


Following is the optional script segment


MACHINE PART Thank you for coming to our play celebrating technology




MACHINE PART Before you go we would like to share with you a few of the ways that simple machines are at work around us every day



MACHINE PARTS Here each student takes a turn stating one use of a simple machine Students can speak about simple machines of 
their choice and illustrate the point with posters they make if they choose Sample statements might be


Four wheels on axles make the school bus go

Screws hold the handles on my bureau drawers at home


Inclined planes called ramps make buildings easier for people in wheelchairs to enter

Pulleys help the flag at city hall go up and down




MACHINE PART We hope you have enjoyed learning about technology and simple machines Thank you for coming to our program



The End
