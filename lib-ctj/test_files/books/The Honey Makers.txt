the honeymakers



It is springtime two beekeepers have placed a beehive on a hill

Activity begins around the hive. The honeybees and the beekeepers are The 
Honey Makers

Honeybee
Colony
Hum Honeybees travel to and from the hive Their earliest ancestors lived about 
80 million years ago The scientific name for honeybee comes from the Latin words
 apis mellifera meaning honey bearer Honeybees are social creatures They form
 highly structured
 groups called colonies In a colony as many as 50000 or more bees live together 
and work at their own special jobs

Wild Honeybee Hive
Wooden Beehive
Many honeybees like to make their homes in dark enclosed places Often a colony of 
wild honeybees builds its hive in a hollow tree Honeybees cared for by today's 
beekeepers live in box-shaped wooden hives

Honey
Cell 
Honeycomb
Inside the beehive the honeybees are building an amazing structure called a 
honeycomb It is made up of countless six-sided cells Stored in many of these 
wax cells is the food that bees and people love to eat honey

Worker bee
Drone bee
Queen bee
Head
Thorax
Large wing or forewing
Small wing or hind wing
Abdomen 
Three simple eyes are believed to be sensitive to light
The two antennae or feelers are used for touch and smell
The long hollow tongue the proboscis sucks up sweet juices called nectar 
from flowers to make honey
Two big compound eyes are made up of many eye lenses joined together
The stinger is used for protection only the females have stingers

Three different kinds of honeybees live inside all beehives There is one 
queen about 100 male drones and thousands of female worker bees Like all insects
 bees have three body parts There is the head the thorax and the abdomen Honeybees
 have other parts too

Drone bee
Queen bee
The queen is the largest of the honeybees and she can live the longest from
 three to five years All the other bees in the colony live for about two months 
except over winter when they live a few months longer It is the queen's job to 
make sure the hive never runs out of bees to do this she leaves the hive to
 mate with her drones Then she lays as many as 2000 eggs a day Drones are 
usually smaller than the queen their only job is to mate with her

Worker bee
Worker brood cell
Queen brood cell or royal cell
Drone brood cell
Most cells in the beehive are used for storing honey but some are used for 
the queen to lay her eggs These are called brood cells In each brood cell a
 bee will develop and grow The largest brood cells are queen brood cells also
 called royal cells Drone brood cells are smaller Even smaller are the worker 
brood cells The eggs in those cells will become worker bees Although all worker
 bees are female they do not lay eggs Instead they do the work of the beehive

Larva
Worker bee called a nurse bee
Beemilk is a milky syrup that is full of nutrition it is made by glands inside 
the nurse worker bee
Beebread is a combination of pollen and honey
Royal jelly is made the same way as beemilk but it is more nutritious
Queen larva
Most eggs the queen lays are no bigger than the period at the end of this 
sentence After three days a larva hatches from each one For the next three 
days worker bees called nurse bees feed the larva beemilk Then they feed it
 beebread A queen larva is fed royal jelly throughout its growth

Cocoon
pupa
Each larva grows quickly then spins a silky cocoon around itself Inside the 
cocoon a pupa develops A nurse bee seals the cell with wax

Metamorphosis
Adult honeybee
Little by little the pupa changes It begins to look more like an adult insect 
This process is called metamorphosis Queens develop in about 16 days from the 
time the eggs are laid The metamorphosis of drones and workers takes about 21 
to 24 days Finally after the transformation is complete an adult bee chews its 
way out of the brood cell an adult honeybee

House bee
Nurse bee
This honeybee is a worker bee from the minute she comes out of her brood cell 
she is as busy as a bee for the next three weeks she will have a number of 
different jobs to do inside the hive First she is a house bee cleaning and 
polishing the cells About three days later she becomes a nurse bee

Wax-making bee
Court 
After ten days of being a nurse bee she becomes a wax-making bee She makes 
flakes of wax in her abdomen and chews them to mold new cells or repair old 
ones Wax-making bees are also in charge of storing the nectar and pollen that 
other honeybees bring back to the hive Other workers care for the queen They
 are her court They cluster around the queen to continually feed and groom her

Stinger
Guard bee
About a week later the wax-making bee becomes a guard bee and begins its outdoor
 life. Guard bees protect the hive They chase away intruders with their stingers
 They also alert the other bees by spreading a special scent when there is danger
 A guard bee will sometimes die in battle to protect the hive and its honey

Forager bee
The worker bee is now about three weeks old She is ready to become a forager 
bee her last job but a very important one Forager bees are the bees you see 
zipping from flower to flower They collect sweet juices called nectar from the
 flowers for honey making

Crop or honey stomach
Proboscis
Pollen basket
At each flower the forager bee collects nectar with her proboscis She stores 
the nectar in a special part of her body called the crop or honey stomach
This stomach is separate from her other stomach As she goes from flower to 
flower she comes in contact with a yellow powder called pollen Some of the 
pollen is collected in little baskets formed by the special hairs on her 
hind legs

Pollination is the movement of pollen from the stamen to the stigma of the 
same kind of plant this makes seeds to grow new plants
Stigma
Stamen
Pollen
As the forager bee collects nectar she carries pollen from flower to flower 
This is part of a process called pollination When she has visited many flowers 
and her crop is full she beelines back to her hive


Honey cell
Wax-making bee
Hive bee
Forager bee
Nectar can be up to 80 percent water when it is first brought to the hive
Back inside the hive the forager bee brings up or regurgitates the nectar 
Then she transfers it by tongue to a hive bee The nectar is passed by tongue
 among the hive bees until some of its moisture is gone Then a wax-making 
bee places the nectar in a honey cell There it continues to dry


Honey is about 18 percent water
More and more nectar is added to the honey cell House bees cluster over the
 cell and fan their wings to evaporate even more of the moisture in the nectar
 as the nectar loses water it becomes thicker and thicker Finally wax-making 
bees cap or seal the cell with wax Slowly the nectar ripens into honey

Dances of the honey bees
When forager bees return to their hive they have a special way of telling the 
other forager bees of important discoveries like a new location of flowers full 
of nectar and pollen They do the dances of the bees

The Circle Dance
The forager honeybee circles in one direction turns around and circles back the
 other way This dance tells the other forager bees to look for new flowers 
anywhere within 300 feet of their hive

The Wag-Tail Dance
This dance tells the other forager honeybees that the flowers are farther than
 300 feet away The direction she dances while wagging her tail tells where the
 flowers are in relation to the sun The number of wags per 15 seconds tells how 
far away the flowers are

A forager honeybee can visit up to 10000 flowers a day All the nectar she 
collects in her entire life can make only about one teaspoon of honey to make 
one pound of honey it takes nectar from over one million flowers Also different
 kinds of honey come from different kinds of flowers



Wild hive
Hollow log hive
Clay pot hive
Hanging movable frame beehive
Skep 
Honeybees have always been valued for the honey they make for thousands of 
years people have stolen honey from wild beehives People became beekeepers when
 they began to make their own hives Some used hollow logs Others used clay pots
 Later in about 1500 European beekeepers started using upside-down basket hives 
called skeps Then in about 1850 the hanging movable-frame beehive was invented


The honey super is the section the beekeepers will harvest
The food chamber is where the bees store the honey they need for their food
The brood chamber is where the queen lays her eggs
Entrance and exit for bees
A foundation is a sheet of wax impressed on both sides with a pattern of honeybee
 cells
On top of the hill is a modern beehive The beehive is stacked in sections in each 
section hang about 10 wooden frames where the bees build their honeycombs to help 
the bees build their honeycombs faster the beekeeper places wax foundations in the
 frames


Helmet with veil
White coveralls with elastic or ties at the wrist and ankles white makes bees feel 
calm
A metal hive tool is used for prying apart frames stuck together
Gloves
Boots
A smoker calms the bees
It's time for the beekeepers to harvest the honey The honeybees have had several
 months to build and fill the honeycombs The colder the winter the more food 
they will need The beekeepers move slowly around the hive They wear special 
clothes and use special equipment to protect themselves from getting stung


Knife
Extractor
Collecting tank
Back at home in a shed the beekeepers use a hot knife to cut the wax caps off the
 honeycomb Then the honeycomb frame is placed inside an extractor It spins around
 at a high speed to remove the honey without breaking the honeycomb The honey goes
 into a collecting tank

Next the honey is filtered through a screen and a cloth to remove small pieces 
of wax Then the honey is packed in airtight jars Sometimes beekeepers melt down
 old and damaged honeycombs to make beeswax candles and other things The rest 
of the empty honeycomb frames are returned to the hive for the honeybees to fill 
again

Honey
For some beekeepers honey making is a hobby They use the honey themselves or 
give it away as gifts Commercial beekeepers provide stores and shops with gleaming
 jars of their product to sell delicious sweet honey from the honey makers


A Beekeeper's Yearbook
March
Spring is coming we uncovered the hive and inspected the bees again some days 
it gets up to  and a few bees are out looking for nectar

April
Another inspection the worker bees are becoming more active we see them hurrying
 to and from the hive they're collecting nectar from early spring blossoms

January
It's been really cold all was safe at the hive after a blowing storm the bees stay
 clustered around their queen to stay warm rotating from the outside to the inside 
of the cluster where it is about

February
Still cold we inspected the hive to see if the bees have enough honey left all
 is well the queen is beginning to lay eggs for the new honey-making season

May 
Lots of activity at the hive now that many spring flowers are in bloom the hive
 must have become too crowded because the old queen left in a swarm with about
 half the colony the new queen looks healthy so we won't have to replace her

June
The bees have been busy as bees they have been zooming to and from the hive 
collecting nectar from early summer flowers we inspected the bees and added
 another super

July 
We collected honey from the top super then replaced it the frames were full of
 honey later we had to stack on another super because the bees are producing so
 much


August
Activity continues some workers are already getting ready for winter they are 
patching cracks inside the hive with propolis to keep the cold winter air out 
we gathered more honey fewer eggs are being laid
Propolis is a glue that bees make from plant resins

September
Activity at the hive is slowing down the bees are still collecting nectar 
from fall flowers we noticed the drone bees were being pushed out of the hive
 to die this way the workers and the queen will have more honey for themselves

October
It's quiet around the hive the food chamber is full of enough honey to get the 
colony through the winter

November
We went up the hill to wrap the hive to help keep it warm inside at this time of
 year the queen doesn't lay any more eggs that way the colony won't grow too 
large for its food supply

December
What a cold winter we know the bees are keeping warm inside their hive by 
clustering together they have lots of honey to live on up to 40 to 60 pounds
 per hive we gave beautiful jars of honey and beeswax candles as gifts for 
Christmas this year

Hum
Stinger
Clover honey
Buckwheat honey
Honey honey honey

Warning worker bees can give painful stings when a honeybee stings tiny hooks
 called barbs on the stinger keep it from coming out of the victim's skin the
 stinger has poison on it when the bee flies away the stinger stays behind the
 bee dies because its insides are damaged so bees sting only when they or their
 hive is in danger

Some people are allergic to bee stings and if stung can become very sick or die
 never approach a hive in the wild or a commercial hive unless you're with 
beekeepers and you're dressed for protection if you get stung tell an adult
 right away

About years ago Greeks used the honeybee as a design on coins

Individual beekeepers prefer different strains of honeybees some common strains 
are Italians Germans Carnolians and Caucasians as well as the African honeybees

Swarming happens when the old queen and some of the colony leave to find a new 
home when a hive becomes overcrowded or a new queen takes over the new queen 
will sting any other queen bee's brood cells this kills any developing queens 
ensuring that she remains the only one unlike the stingers of worker bees the
 queen's stinger does not come out of her body

The cells of a honeycomb tilt slightly upward so the honey won't spill out

On a hot summer day the worker bees keep the hive cool inside by fanning their
 wings

There are about cells in each honeycomb frame

Apiculture is beekeeping or the study of honeybees an apiary is a beeyard or 
place where colonies of bees are kept

Honeybees pollinate more flowers than any other insect some commercial beekeepers
 provide pollination services for agriculture

Bees make different flavors and shades of honey that's because they collect
 nectar from different kinds of flowers

Some colonies can produce pounds of honey in a year

Throughout the world beekeepers harvest about one million tons of honey each 
year the United States ranks third in the world in honey production
