The Very Hungry Caterpillar 

In the light of the moon a little egg lay on a leaf 
One Sunday morning the warm sun came up and pop out of the egg came a tiny and very hungry caterpillar 
He started to look for some food 
On Monday he ate through one apple But he was still hungry 
On Tuesday he ate through two pears but he was still hungry 
On Wednesday he ate through three plums but he was still hungry 
On Thursday he ate through four strawberries but he was still hungry
 On Friday he ate through five oranges but he was still hungry 
On Saturday he ate through one piece of chocolate cake one ice cream one pickle one slice of Swiss cheese one slice of salami one lollipop one piece of cherry pie one sausage one cupcake and one slice of watermelon. 
That night he had a stomachache
 The next day was Sunday again The caterpillar ate through one nice green leaf and after that he felt much better 
Now he wasn't hungry anymore and he wasn't a little caterpillar any more He was a big fat caterpillar 
He built a small house called a cocoon around   
himself He stayed inside for more than two weeks Then he nibbled a hole in the cocoon pushed his way out and 
he was a beautiful butterfly
