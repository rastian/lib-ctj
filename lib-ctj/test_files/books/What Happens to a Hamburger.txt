I like to eat I like bread and pears and celery I like carrots and chicken and 
french fries and hamburgers I like juice and milk What do you like 

Milk

Good food makes you strong and healthy It gives you energy and helps you grow Your 
body uses food in different ways It uses some kinds of food to make strong bones 
and hard teeth It turns other food into solid muscles It uses some of the food you 
eat to keep warm Before your body can do these things it has to change the food 
Solid foods like hamburgers and french fries have to be changed into liquids 
Liquids like milk and juice have to be changed too When you change the food you eat 
you are digesting it milk



Sugar cubes 
Sugar cubes 
Sugar cubes


Put two cubes of sugar into an empty glass Take a wooden spoon and pound the lumps 
with the handle Pound them until they are broken up into powder Now pour some water 
into the glass and stir Keep stirring until the sugar powder has disappeared Take a 
sip of the water Can you taste the sugar The sugar has disappeared but it is still 
there It has broken up into millions of tiny pieces Your eye cannot see them but 
your tongue can taste them



When you digest your food you break it up into millions of very tiny pieces You 
start to do this as soon as you take a bite to eat Digestion begins in your mouth 
when you chew You break up the food with your teeth

 times
 times


Get a piece of raw carrot and a plate Take a bite of carrot and chew it ten times 
Spit the carrot out onto one side of the plate Take another bite Chew it thirty 
times Spit out that mouthful on the other side of the plate Can you see the 
difference The longer you chew food the smaller the pieces will be


Saliva

Tongue

Salivary glands


Something else helps to break up the food in your mouth It is a fluid Many people 
call it spit Its scientific name is saliva Whenever you take a bite of food saliva 
pours into your mouth You say your mouth is watering Saliva comes from small glands 
in your cheeks and under your tongue Sometimes saliva pours into your mouth even 
before you take a bite The smell of food will start it Take a good sniff of a 
brownie Sniff an open jar of pickles Now sniff a slice of pizza What other kinds of 
food make your mouth water




Epiglottis opened

Epiglottis closed

Trachea windpipe

Esophagus gullet

Chewed food

Throat squeezing 
Lung



After you have chewed your food you swallow it Your epiglottis closes That is a 
door that keeps food from going down your trachea windpipe and into your lungs 
Your throat squeezes together when you swallow It pushes food down into your 
esophagus Another name for esophagus is gullet 


Esophagus gullet 
Muscle squeezing 
shut 
Muscle pushing food down to stomach 
Stomach


Inside the stomach 

Your gullet is a tube that leads from the back of your mouth to 
your stomach There are muscles in your gullet that squeeze together They push food 
into your stomach Your stomach is a tube like your gullet But there is a difference 
Your stomach can stretch like a balloon When you eat your stomach stretches to hold 
the food




Digestive fluids

Stomach

Tiny glands



After you swallow your meal your stomach muscles begin to squeeze The food is 
mashed and stirred together Your stomach has fluids in it like the saliva in your 
mouth They are called digestive fluids They pour in from tiny glands in the sides 
of the stomach The digestive fluids help to break the food up into smaller and 
smaller pieces 
Food stays in your stomach for several hours Some kinds of food stay 
only about two hours Other kinds stay longer The food stays until all the lumps 
have been broken up It is like a thick soup now It is made of millions and millions 
of tiny pieces But digestion has just begun The tiny pieces must be made even 
smaller This happens in your intestines

Small intestine 
Large intestine

Inside the small intestine

Inside the large intestine



There are two intestines in your body the small intestine and the large intestine 
They are really one single long tube This tube is coiled up inside you like a pile 
of heavy rope It is about twenty-one feet long Most of the tube is narrow and is 
called the small intestine The last four or five feet of the tube are much wider 
This part is called the large intestine 


Liver

Stomach

Soupy food

Digestive fluids

Molecules

Pancreas

Groups of cholesterol molecules



The soupy food is squeezed into the small intestine from the stomach Digestive 
fluids from the livers and another organ called the pancreas are mixed with the 
food in the small intestine These fluids break the food up into very tiny pieces 
called molecules Molecules are so small you cannot see them without a special 
microscope




Blood vessels

Lymph vessels

Food molecules

Small intestine

Undigested food



The food molecules pass into tiny blood vessels and lymph vessels in the walls of 
the small intestine They move into you blood Then your blood carries them to every 
part of your body 




Restroom


Water molecules

Small intestine

Large intestine

Undigested food

Blood vessels



The part of the food that is not digested in the small intestine is squeezed into 
the large intestine From here water molecules pass into the bloodstream

Your body cannot use all of the food you eat The food it cannot use is stored in 
the large intestine You rid of the unused food when you go to the toilet




Milk 
Cereal



In the morning you may eat scrambled eggs or cereal You may drink orange juice or 
milk In a few hours your body has digested the food Then your blood begins to carry 
the tiny food molecules to your muscles to make them stronger to your bones and 
teeth to make them harder to every part of your body to give you energy and help 
you grow

How long is your small intestine

Find a spool of string a marker and a pair of scissors

Unroll the spool of string from the bottom of your foot to the top of your head

Mark that spot on the string with a marker

Place the part of the string with the spot under your foot and unroll the spool 
until it reaches the top of your head again

Repeat steps and one more time

After you mark the third spot on the string place that spot under your foot and 
unroll the spool until it reaches your waist

Mark that spot with the marker and then snip the string with scissors at the fourth 
spot the length of the string is about the length of your small intestine it is 
about three and a half times as long as your own body is


How do the digestive fluids in your body affect food

Gather these materials

Clear-plastic cups

A marker pen or pencil

Pieces of masking tape

Spoons

Spoonfuls of milk

Spoonfuls of water

Spoonfuls of lemon juice

Plastic wrap

Rubber bands


Label the cups water and lemon by writing the words on the two pieces of masking 
tape and then sticking one on the outside of each cup

Put three spoonfuls of milk in each cup 
Use a clean spoon to add two spoonfuls of 
water to the cup labeled water stir
 Use a clean spoon to add two spoonfuls of lemon 
juice to the cup labeled lemon stir 
Cover each cup with plastic wrap use a rubber 
band to keep the plastic wrap in place 
Wait for about a minute and then look 
closely at each cup of milk write down what you see 
Wait two hours and then look 
closely at each cup of milk again write down what you see you'll notice that the 
water doesn't change the milk but the lemon juice separates the milk into a lumpy 
white mass at the bottom of the cup and a clear liquid at the top your stomach 
contains liquids that act on foods in the same way the lemon juice changes the 
milk
