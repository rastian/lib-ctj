where do chicks come from








This is an egg You've seen eggs before but this one is different In three weeks 
a chick will hatch out of this egg 




Unfertilized eggs

Yolk begins to grow

Albumen forms 
around fertilized eggs

Shell develops



An egg begins as a tiny white spot inside the 
mother chicken the hen There may be many tiny eggs inside the hen at one time A 
yellow yolk grows around each egg



Then the father chicken the rooster mates with 
the hen His sperm joins the growing egg This Is called fertilization Soon a clear 
jelly-like egg white or albumen grows around the yolk Finally a hard shell forms 
The egg is ready to be laid




The hen lays the egg Over the next few days she lays 
several more eggs The hen sits on top of the eggs to keep them warm as soon as 
the eggs are warm the chicks start growing




Inside the warm egg is everything a chick
 needs to grow



The yellow yolk contains liquid food


A thin white skin grows around 
the yolk and albumen and sticks to the inside of the shell it holds the albumen 
together to cushion the growing chick 


The albumen contains water and a little
 more food



At one end of the egg is an air space This is where the chick will take
 its first breath




The egg you eat for breakfast could never grow into a chick 
because it was never fertilized Otherwise all parts inside the egg are the same





The hen has warmed her eggs for three days now inside the chicks are growing 



DAY 
3 The chick looks like the letter with a dark spot in the middle This spot is 
its heart The heart pumps blood The blood carries water and food from the yolk and 
albumen to the growing chick The chick's waste collects in a small sac



DAY 5 The 
chick's head is now half as big as its body and its eyes are very large its tail 
has begun to grow Wings and legs are forming




Briefly the hen leaves the eggs to 
find food and water She quickly returns to warm them again




DAY 7 The chick is only
 one inch long about as long as your big toe Even so it is already starting to 
look like a chicken The chick's eyes stomach brain and toes have started to grow 
A beak has started to grow too but it is very soft The chick's wings are folded 
across its chest



DAY 10 Every day the chick uses up more of the food from the yolk 
The chick lies on its back inside the egg its wings legs and beak are fully grown.





Sometimes the hen turns the eggs over She keeps them warm on all sides




DAY 11 
The chick can open and close its beak now it wiggles and bends within the 
albumen Tiny bumps appear all over the chick's skin in a few days feathers will 
grow from these bumps



DAY 14 The chick is tightly curled inside the egg It turns 
to lie on its side As the chick uses up more and more of the yolk and albumen 
the waste bag expands The chick has grown a special bump on the end of its beak 
This is called the egg tooth




The hen clucks softly and turns her eggs again The 
chicks are learning to recognize the sound of their mother's voice The hen no 
longer leaves her eggs She will not eat or drink again until after they have 
hatched




DAY 18 The chick has grown so big that it touches the inside of the shell 
on every side Soft feathers called down cover its head and body The chick uses 
up the last of the yolk The yolk will give the chick energy to hatch and then 
rest for a few days without eating



DAY 20 The chick practices breathing in one 
day it will hatch




Inside the eggshell the chick pecks a hole into the air space 
at the end of the egg it takes its first breath and goes Cheep Cheep Cluck cluck 
answers the hen




The next day the chick pecks a tiny hole in the shell using its egg 
tooth This is tough work for the chick After making the hole the chick sleeps for 
a few hours




When the chick wakes up it pecks for hours it pecks a circle around 
the inside of the shell



Next it pushes hard against one side of the shell with its 
feet Then it pushes hard against the other side with its neck and shoulders 




Crack 
The chick has hatched The shell and the dried-up waste sac fall away The chick 
doesn't need its egg tooth anymore in a few days it will fall off




The chick is 
tired it rests its wobbly legs as the other chicks finish hatching




The hen fluffs 
her feathers and spreads her wings to cover and warm her new chicks The babies 
nestle close to their mother and sleep as they rest their down dries Their legs 
and necks grow stronger




Hours later the fluffy chick is the first to run out from 
beneath its mother's wings The others soon follow Together the hen and her new 
chicks search for food in the barnyard

Can you 
break an egg

Try this with an uncooked egg and a large bowl Hold the egg in the 
palm of your hand over the bowl now squeeze the egg as hard as you can the egg 
should not break the bowl is there just in case there is a tiny crack in the egg 
the only reason it should break in your hand like the pressure from the palm of 
your hand a hen's weight spreads out evenly over the rounded shape of the 
eggshell when she sits on an egg this ensures that her egg won't break



Inside an 
egg

Ask an adult to help you break an uncooked egg into a small bowl look closely 
can you identify the yellow yolk and the gooey clear albumen now do you see what 
look like twisted white strings these are called the chalazae pronounced  they 
help keep the yolk in place and protected within the egg


Look inside the shell 
can you see the air sac attached to the wider end of the egg after you have 
finished your observations you might want to make scrambled eggs or an omelet


Roll an egg


For this activity you will need some newspaper and an uncooked egg 
spread out a piece of newspaper on the floor or tabletop place the egg on the 
paper and give it a gentle push watch to see how it rolls does it roll fast and 
straight like a soccer ball or does it wobble and move in a circular motion why 
do you think this is do you think the egg's shape makes it easier or harder for 
the hen to take care of it
