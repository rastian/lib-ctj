whoever you are 
Little one whoever you are wherever you are there are little ones just like you all over the world Their skin may be different from yours and their homes may be different from yours 
Their schools may be different from yours and their lands may be different from yours
Their lives may be different from yours and their words may be very different from yours
But inside their hearts are just like yours whoever they are wherever they are all over the world 
Their smiles are like yours and they laugh just like you
Their hurts are like yours and they cry like you too 
whoever they are wherever they are all over the world
Little one when you are older and when you are grown you may be different 
and they may be different wherever you are wherever they are in this big wide world 
But remember this Joys are the same and love is the same Pain is the same and blood is the same Smiles are the same and hearts are just the same wherever they are wherever you are wherever we are all over the world
