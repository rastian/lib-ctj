introduction don't eat don't touch don't well just don't 


All over the world there are animals that can hurt or
kill you with a bite  a stab  a sting  or a spit and others
that can hurt or kill if you bite them  These creatures can
be found in many habitats  They ride the waves  They
hide in the sand  They coil around branches  They buzz
around the garden  They even sleep in your closet  And
every one of them is toxic 
Some animals are poisonous  They can make you sick
if you eat them or if you absorb their toxins through
your skin  They use their poison purely as self defense
against predators  and that includes people  Sometimes a
poisonous critter tastes bad enough to make a predator
spit it right out  If your dog or you were to bite
a toxic toad  yuck! But sample some puffer fish  and
chances are you wouldn't even know you could be consuming
a poison that might kill you 
The most famed toxic critters are venomous  This
means they must inject their poison their venom into a
victim by means of fangs  teeth  spines  stingers  or spurs 
These creatures include snakes  spiders  jellyfish  bees 
wasps  scorpions  and a bunch of less familiar animals  But
believe it or not  if they can avoid it  none of these creatures
wants to waste their venom on inedible YOU!


if looks could kill they wouldn't need poison
One reason animals use venom is to catch
prey insects  rodents  fish  small mammals 
and even others of their own kind  People
are too big to be food for venomous animals 
However  if by accident or on purpose we
harm these creatures  they will strike back to
protect themselves  Self defense is a second
major reason animals use venom  A third reason
is defense of their family or community 
How dangerous a poisonous or venomous
animal is to humans depends on how strong
its toxins are  how much of them get into you 
and how your body reacts to them

talking about toxins
So what exactly are these toxins? Biotoxins
are substances that are created by living cells or
organisms to harm or kill prey or enemies  They
are mostly made up of proteins  Proteins carry out
important functions in animals' bodies  They form
hair  muscles  hemoglobin  part of red blood cells  
and enzymes  large molecules that speed up chemical
reactions   They can make hormones  substances
that give instructions to various body parts  They
can produce antibodies to fight infection 
But proteins can also be destroyers  The
proteins in various toxins often in the form of
enzymes attack cells and tissues  disrupt communication
between nerve endings  and cause
other damage 
Different poisonous or venomous animals
produce specific types of toxins or a combination
of several kinds  Neurotoxins affect the nervous
system and brain  making the victim unable to
move and breathe  Hemotoxins target and destroy
red blood cells  Necrotoxins destroy all types of
tissues  There are other toxins  as well  that specifically
affect the heart  the muscles  the kidneys 
and other vital organs 
Most venom circulates through the lymphatic
system  Lymph is a fluid that protects the body
from germs  It moves slowly  but thoroughly  and
it eventually flows into the bloodstream  Besides
little blood vessels called capillaries  there are lymph
channels in our skin  and many toxins enter those
channels first  although some kinds of venom can
go right into the bloodstream  Snake venom  for
example  is usually circulated by the lymphatic system 
but it can sometimes enter the bloodstream
directly it depends on the size of the molecules
of the toxins  the length of the snake's fangs  where
on the victim the fangs strike  and other factors 
Some venoms can cause
serious injury or even death
by triggering a systemic  whole
body  reaction  Other venoms
cause a localized reaction  For
example  bee and wasp venoms
usually raise a painful lump at the location of
the sting unless the victim is allergic to these toxins 
Then he or she may have a systemic reaction 

When people get stung or bitten by venomous
animals  it is called an envenomation  Doctors
will sometimes treat the victim with antivenins to
fight the toxins  To make an antivenin  scientists
extract venom from the animal  often by getting
it to bite cloth stretched across a bottle or tube 
Then the venom is purified  dried  and frozen  A
weak solution of it is injected into a donor mammal 
which is most often a horse or a sheep  The
mammal doesn't die  It produces antibodies cells
to fight the poison  Blood is drawn from the
donor  and the antibodies are extracted and then
processed into the antivenin 
Each venom requires a different anti venin 
For some dangerous venoms  there are no known
antivenins  Fortunately  most venom is not deadly 
at least  not to humans  Other creatures that
meet up with venomous animals are not so lucky 
As for the venomous critters themselves  most are
immune to their own toxins they can't be hurt
by them 
Now let's travel the globe to meet some of
these killer critters and find out how they use
toxins and why  Where shall we start? How about
your own house


processing antivenin eggs to the rescue
milking a snake for its venom
site of a bee sting
a rattlesnake's venom left is mainly hemotoxic
while a cobra's right is neurotoxic

 Some people are allergic to horses and can have a bad reaction
to antivenin made from their antibodies  In addition  antivenin
is expensive to produce and requires drawing a lot of mammal
blood  which causes discomfort to the donors  So scientists are
working on other ways to produce antivenins 
In India  where snakes bite about three hundred thousand
people every year and ten percent of the victims die  biochemists
are working on a unique method of making antivenin  They give
young hens small doses of snake venom and  as they grow older 
the chickens develop special proteins in their blood that act as
antidotes against the toxins  These proteins are passed on to their
eggs and build up in the yolks  The eggs are then collected  and
the proteins are extracted to make the antivenin 
This method could turn out to be safer and a lot less expensive
than extracting antivenin from horses  Fifty eggs produce
the same amount of antivenin as two pints of horse blood  Since
a single hen can lay more than two hundred forty eggs each
year and there are many more hens available than horses that
would produce a lot of antivenin  And that would be good news
for people  and for horses  too  


home is where venom is you are not the only animal that thinks your home is cozy
many uninvited critters live with us some such as mice rats houseflies bedbugs 
fleas lice aren't toxic. others are for one familiar group of these 
venomous creatures our homes provide not only food and dark corners to 
hide in but also perfect places to spin webs what are they you guessed it spiders 
 spiders and their bigger cousins 
parts of an arachnid
legs chelicerae
abdomen
cephalothorax

Spiders are not insects  They are arachnids 
Insects have six legs  and their bodies have three
sections  head  thorax  and abdomen   Arachnids
have eight legs  mouth parts  and their bodies consist
of two parts  the cephalothorax and the abdomen 
There are close to forty thousand species of spiders 
as compared to about a million species of insects 
Most spiders are meat eaters  and almost all
are venomous  They produce venom in special
glands and inject it through the fangs at the tips
of their chelicerae their mouth parts  The shape
of their fangs  straight or curved  differs among
species  Their venom paralyzes or kills prey  The
idea that it also helps turn the prey into liquid food
is probably untrue  Spiders do liquefy prey  but
they use digestive juices from their gut that they
throw up  several times if necessary  onto the prey 
Once the victim is liquefied  the spider can then
suck it up through its specialized mouth  which is
a slit and has hairs that act as a filter 
Smaller spiders eat insects and other spiders 
If the prey is small enough  they may not even
bother with venom  They will just crush or chew
it with their chelicerae and liquefy it with their
digestive juices  Larger spiders eat insects and
other spiders  too  but they may also feed on
mice  birds  frogs  lizards  and snakes sometimes
even poisonous ones 

Different types of spiders hunt in different
ways  Some spin sticky silken webs to catch prey
or make"trigger” lines over burrows that alert
the spider to prey walking over them  Some cast
silken nets  Others don't use silk for hunting at
all they stalk prey on the ground 
Many spiders use silk to wrap up their victims 
This prevents the prey from struggling and
hurting the spider  It also means the prey can be
stored and eaten later  Some spiders bite first 
then wrap their prey  others wrap first  then bite 
And they're just waiting to bite you  right?
Nope  Few spiders can or want to harm you  Like
other venomous animals  arachnids use a lot of
their body's resources to produce venom  So  they
won't waste it unless it's absolutely necessary 
Furthermore  most have fangs that are too small
to penetrate our skin or venom that is too weak to
hurt us  The common house spider  Achaearanea
tepidariorum   for
example  is harmless
to people  In
fact  like many
of its cousins  it's
actually helpful
because it rids our homes of a variety of insect
pests  including houseflies and mosquitoes 
Spiders that can bite people usually do so only
if they are grabbed or otherwise trapped against
our skin  or if they need to protect their egg sacs
or young  Most prefer to run away  Even when
their fangs do pierce our skin  spiders often"dry”
bite they don't expel venom 
Many people think they've been bitten by
spiders when they've actually been zapped by
something else  Spiders tend to bite just once 
A row or group of bites usually means fleas  bed
bugs  mites  or mosquitoes are what got you 

spider and egg sac
tarantulas hairy yes deadly not really
check out any horror film featuring spiders and you're likely to see large hairy 
tarantulas with deadly fangs often crawling on the victim's bed but don't believe
everything you see in the movies although it's true that these creatures of deserts
rainforests and other habitats do sometimes enter homes they are rarely lethal the bites
of north and south american tarantulas are generally no worse than bee stings and they usually
don't bite at all although they have some relatives that are more dangerous. they don't even mind
being handled which is why some people keep them as pets if you ever get to hold a tarantula be 
careful never to drop it its abdomen is fragile and the spider can be badly injured in a fall
tarantulas have a second defense besides venom they kick off microscopic urticating irritating hairs
usually from the topside of their abdomen to blind and otherwise deter enemies the hairs can sting 
and itch human eyes noses and skin but they contain no venom at all tarantulas that are used to being
handled are less likely to flick these hairs


a few spiders miss muffet should avoid

So  which spiders are the big biters? In the
    most painful spider bites come from the
yellow sac spider  Cheiracanthium inclusum   the
red backed jumping spider  Phidippus johnsoni  
and a few other species found around our homes 
A jumping spider's bite may cause localized swelling
and pain  A sac spider's bite can be quite
painful  and the wound may take a long time to
heal  Its venom can also cause headache  fever 
nausea  dizziness  and even shock  But serious
problems from these spider bites are rare 
Only three types of spiders are considered
truly dangerous to people in this country: the
black widow  Latrodectus mactans  and other
widow species  the brown recluse  Loxosceles
reclusa  and some of its relatives  and the hobo
spider  Tegenaria agrestis  
Shiny black with a red hourglass mark on its
belly  the black widow is the best known and most
venomous spider in America  It likes dark places 
including basements  sheds  woodpiles  and outdoor
toilets  where it spins a tangled  criss cross
web  Only the females bite  But do they live up
to their name? Do they really kill and eat their
mates? Yes  occasionally  they do in order to get
enough nourishment to lay eggs  However  when
it comes to harming people  these ladies are
rather shy and tend to run away rather than
attack 

Black widows  found all over the     rarely
kill humans  but they can make us quite sick  causing
not only fever  nausea  and pain  but also high
blood pressure and severely rigid muscles  In the
worst cases  a victim can have trouble breathing  A
black widow's neurotoxic venom is fifteen times
more potent than a rattlesnake's! But it's not as
dangerous to people because a spider injects much
less venom than a snake does 
There are widow species all over the world 
and one of them  the brown widow  Latrodectus
geometricus   which has a yellow hourglass mark 
has now moved into the Mississippi Gulf Coast
region  It probably made its way there from
Florida  hitching a ride with imported plants 
food  furniture  or building materials  The brown
widow is a very timid spider  preferring to curl
up into a ball and drop to the ground as its main
defense  When it does bite  it is to protect its egg
sac  Fortunately  its
venom seems to be
far less potent than
its cousin's and causes
mostly a localized
reaction 


my roommate is a frog
colombian lesser black
brown widow spider
black widow spider
red backed jumping spider
yellow sac spider
hobo spider
 Although tarantulas eat frogs  as well as insects  lizards 
and small mammals   several species  such as the Colombian
lesser black   Xenesthis immanis    will peacefully share their burrows
with these amphibians  Scientists guess that the frogs
protect the spiders' eggs by eating ants that would otherwise
feed on those eggs  And the spiders protect the frogs from
being eaten by other predators 


The brown recluse lives in the South Central
and the Midwest states  It is found in areas such
as in closets  behind furniture  and on the floor 
People are most likely to be bitten if they put on
clothes or shoes they haven't worn in a while or
if they roll on the spider in bed  The recluse's
venom is necrotoxic  Its bite may be painless
when delivered  but later the area often becomes
swollen and tender and develops into a wound
that takes weeks or even months to heal 
You can recognize a recluse by the violin shaped
mark on its head and back  the neck of
the violin points toward the rear   If you have a
magnifying glass  you can also see that  unlike
most other spiders  it has six eyes instead of eight 
The hobo spider was originally a field dweller
from Europe  It hitched a ride on cargo ships
bound for northwestern America and quickly
adapted to rural areas and small towns with cool 
moist climates  Hobo spiders live in grassy areas 
amid rubble  and around foundations  The males
occasionally enter houses  The effects of its bite
are similar to that of the brown recluse 
The hobo spider is a type of funnel web
weaver  Its flat web has a funnel at the back where
the spider waits for prey  Unlike the webs of many
other spiders  this spider's web isn't sticky  It trips
up the prey's legs  and then the spider dashes out
to bite the victim 
Hobo spiders are generally not aggressive 
But another funnel web weaver  one more related
to the tarantula  is  The Sydney funnel web
spider  Atrax robustus   which nests in shaded
garden areas around Sydney  a large city in
Australia  is quicker to attack particularly the
male  which is five or six times more venomous
than the female  Like a miniature horror movie
monster  the spider rears up and threatens you
right back  with potent venom dripping from
its fangs 
The worst time to meet this arachnid is when
the males are wandering around looking for
mates  The male's neurotoxic venom contains a
special substance called robustoxin  It is not particularly
harmful to dogs or cats  but it can be
fatal to humans and other primates 
as males wander they may enter a house and hide in 
clothing or bedding  where they're more likely to
encounter people  They also occasionally fall into swimming
pools  but they don't immediately drown  They can
trap a small air bubble in their abdomen hairs and stay
alive  and capable of biting  for hours underwater 
Because of its potent venom and the fact that it
lives in a city of four million people  this arachnid is one of
the most dangerous spiders in the world  In the past  people
have died from its bite  Fortunately  there is now an
antivenin available to treat victims

that which doesn't kill you might just cure you


Venoms are necessary for the production of
antivenins  But that's not all they're good for  Scientists are
actively studying spider venoms to discover treatments
and cures for a variety of disorders  For example  they
have isolated a chemical in tarantula venom that may
help stop atrial fibrillation  irregular heartbeat   a major
cause of death 
In addition  spider venom may prove to be a farmer's
good friend  The Blue Mountains funnel web spider
 Hadronyche versuta  is a species whose bite is lethal to
humans and other beings  Australian biochemists have
isolated the neurotoxins in its venom that paralyze
insects  In the venom  there are individual substances
that target specific prey  Scientists are hoping to design
insecticides that will be toxic to bugs  but not to anything
else  The Blue Mountains funnel web spider is not the only
species that may be the source of pest control  There are
thousands of arachnids yet to be studied and quite a few
scientists willing to study them 


ticked off
Ticks are also arachnids  They can carry a
wide variety of serious diseases  such as Rocky
Mountain spotted fever and Lyme disease 
which are caused by bacteria and other organisms 
not venom  Only one known tick borne
illness is caused by a neurotoxin: tick paralysis 
The tick transmits this neurotoxin through its
saliva as it feeds  and the arachnid has to be
embedded attached to the host for a while to
do so  The symptoms are weakness  lack of muscle
control  and eventual paralysis  which can
lead to respiratory failure and death  Fortunately 
the illness usually clears up if the tick is removed
quickly enough 
To prevent tick bites  veterinarians suggest
insecticides for your pets  For people in tick infested
areas  doctors recommend repellents and
also protective clothing  such as long pants tucked
into your socks 
Although several varieties of ticks carry this
neurotoxin  most don't seem to cause the illness 
However  in Australia there is a species known as
the paralysis tick  Ixodes holocyclus   Dogs  cats 
and people  especially children  have been victims
of its potent toxin  But possums and bandicoots
have not  These two families of Australian mammals
are immune 

they've got legs and they know how to use them

In our homes  spiders aren't the only venomous
critters that find good pickings among
the many insects that live with us  Centipedes
 Scutigera  like to make a meal out of common
household bugs  too  In the wild  they like moist
forest floors  In our homes  they've adapted to the
dampness of our bathrooms and basements 
Centipedes are not insects  They have many
body segments and fifteen to one hundred and
fifty pairs of legs to go with them  The first is a
pair of claws called prehensors that have adapted
for grasping prey and injecting venom  Some of
these critters  such as the colorful twelve inch long 
bat eating  rainforest centipede  Scolopendra
gigantea   deliver painful envenomations  The
small house centipede  Scutigera coleoptrata  in
your bathtub may also be able to stab  but it can't
cause you much injury and it gets rid of lots of
pests  including bed bugs!
Millipedes  relatives of the centipedes  have
twenty to one hundred body segments  most
with two pairs of legs each  Living outdoors  they
eat leaves and decaying vegetation  and most are
not venomous at all  They have a tough exoskeleton 
and their main defense is to roll into a tight 
hard ball 
But some species are poisonous  such as the
yellow spotted millipede  Harpaphe haydeniana  
Like a few uncommon centipede species  they
emit acid or liquid hydrogen cyanide a toxin
sometimes featured in murder mysteries to
repel predators  such as ants and toads  Although
millipedes don't discharge enough of these poisons
to hurt people  it's a good idea not to touch
your eyes after handling this species 
Black lemurs  primates found in Madagascar 
and South American capuchin monkeys are known
to rub millipedes on
themselves  using the
poison to repel insect
pests 
Spiders  centipedes 
and millipedes are
helpful animals with
every right to live  But
when it comes to sharing
our house and yard
with these beings  most
of us would probably
prefer roommates that
don't stab  bite  or ooze 

ticks must be attached to a host to transmit diseases or neurotoxins
the brushtail possum top and the long nosed bandicoot bottom are
immune to the paralysis tick's venom

what is lovelier than a garden roses and daises they're a feast for the eyes and nose tomatoes and 
peppers they're a treat for the taste buds yes a garden is a delight for you and also for things
 that sting 
honeybee

bee careful
Zipping past your petunias is one of the most
dangerous animals in America one you might
see every summer day  It kills more people in the
   than any other venomous animal  Yet most
of us are happy to see it fly by  because without it
we might not have such lovely petunias at all 
What is this bold critter? None other than the
honeybee  Apis mellifera  
There are different types of bees  Many
spread pollen to help our gardens grow  Some 
such as carpenter bees  Xylocopa   are solitary 
They nest in burrows or holes that the females
carve in dead wood  The bees we are most familiar
with bumblebees  Bombus terrestris  and
honeybees live communally 
Each colony has a strict social structure  The
queen produces eggs  The female workers take
care of the hive  They perform tasks such as gathering
pollen and nectar  making honey  fighting
off intruders  and building and repairing cells out
of wax to store food and house the larvae the
young  The males  called drones  don't work at all 
Nor can they sting  They mate in midair with the
queen and die shortly afterwards 
Almost all bees are vegetarians  living on nectar
and pollen from flowers  They use their venom
strictly to protect themselves or their colonies 
Oddly enough  some stingless bees  Meliponini  
which have no venom at all  are the only meat eaters
in this family  They live on carrion  rotting
flesh  and other animal material instead of pollen
and are nicknamed the "vulture bees ”


The bee's stinger has
developed over time from
what was once its ovipositor 
its egg laying tube  In all but
one species  the honeybee's
stinger is barbed to hook and remain in the victim and to
keep pumping venom  As the bee flies away  the insect's
abdomen tears  and the bee soon dies  Sometimes its victim
dies  too especially if many bees have stung it 
When workers near their hive sense danger  the bees
give off an alarm pheromone a chemical signal they can
detect  This alerts all the hive's inhabitants  and they
become ready to attack if necessary  If any of them do
strike  the glands responsible for producing the alarm
pheromone detach along with the stinger and keep giving
off the signal to attack 
Bee stings are painful for a reason  American entomologist
Justin  Schmidt feels that pain is responsible for the
insect's survival  The pain of the sting fools a predator into
thinking that the bee has caused more serious damage than
it actually has  and thus the victim will avoid it in future 
It's certainly true that although it hurts a lot  the
venom from a single sting is not strong enough to kill
most animals  including humans unless you are allergic
to the venom  Some sources say that as many as four people
in one thousand have systemic reactions to bee stings 
When allergic people are stung  they can go into anaphylactic
shock their whole bodies react so badly that they
may stop breathing  To survive  they need an epinephrine
shot  followed by a trip to the doctor or emergency room 
There are kits with epinephrine syringes available for
people with this allergy  The high number of allergic
people  plus the fact that bees and humans are common
neighbors  explains why these insects are dangerous 

bee healthy apitherapy queen bee
 apitherapy is the use of natural products from bees including pollen honey and venom
to cure a wide range of disorders bee venom has at least forty different ingredients
the main one is mellitin which is responsible for the ouch in a bee sting it is also a 
powerful anti inflammatory agent for centuries apitherapists have treated arthritis and other
inflammations of the joints by allowing bees to sting patients on certain points of their bodies
today live bees are still used but some practitioners prefer venom filled syringes instead
there have been few documented scientific studies but many patients claim that the venom 
helps them
currently mellitin is being investigated as a treatment for multiple sclerosis and for cancer
among other diseases bees for breakfast
bee eater
what kind of crazy bird eats bees a bee eater of course example merops nubicoides these 
brightly colored residents found in africa asia australia and southern europe pursue many kinds
of flying insects but honeybees are their favorites they catch the bees take them to a perch and 
remove their stingers by pounding and rubbing the insects against a hard surface
a bee eater isn't interested in a sitting bee or other bug even if that insect lands right next 
to it. these birds will only hunt things on the wing

africanized honey bees with queens
will the real killer bees please stand up fly up
which of these is the real killer bee 
european honeybee
africanized honeybee
bumblebee
cicada killer
answer
number and yes it looks just like its relative number 
cousins

Honeybees were originally brought to the
Americas from Europe in the early seventeenth
century  Then  in 1956  some colonies of African
honeybees were imported to South America to
improve the bee industry in Brazil  This African
variety produced a lot of honey  and the bees
seemed better suited to the warmer climate than
their European relatives  The following year  some
of the bees escaped from an experimental apiary
 the place where beehives are kept   and they
began to interbreed with
the European bees
already living there  The
Africanized honeybees  or
killer bees  were their offspring 
They are now found
in Central America and
parts of the     as well as South America 
The reason they are called killer bees is not
because their venom is any more dangerous than
that of the European bees  It isn't  They got their
name because they defend their colonies more
aggressively  For example  they may attack a person
for approaching too near a hive something
European bees are less likely to do  When they do
attack  killer bees sting in greater numbers and for
a longer time  and they will pursue their enemies
farther from their nest  A person who isn't allergic
to bee venom can  perhaps  survive as many as
three hundred stings  A swarm of killer bees has
been known to deliver ten thousand stings 
Are you likely to be pursued by an American
colony of killer bees? Not really  But let's suppose
a swarm comes after you  What should you do?
You should not jump into water the bees will
be waiting for you when you get out  Instead  get
inside a car or building  or just run! Killer bees
may be fierce and persistent  but they're also slow 
and  even though they fly further from their hive
than European bees  they still don't want to travel
too far  There's a good chance that you can outrace
them though you may have to run several
hundred yards before they give up 


 if you get stung by a bee

Many folks insist that
you must never pull out a bee
stinger because squeezing it
will make it pump more venom
into you  They advise scraping
away the stinger with your fingernail  a credit card  or some
other object with an edge  However  in a 1996 article in The
Lancet   the British journal of medicine  the researchers said
that it doesn't matter how  you remove the stinger because
it pumps through a valve system and not by compression 
What is  important is that you get that stinger out fast so it
stops pumping  period 
Whether you've been stung by
a bee or wasp  you should wash the
area  and then put ice on it to
reduce swelling and pain  Calamine
lotion  calendula gel  or other
itch pain relieving creams may also
help  Some people use teabags 
baking soda paste  or meat tenderizer 
which contains papain   an enzyme that breaks down the
toxins in the venom

wasp waisted

Wasps and bees are close relatives  In fact 
bees and ants evolved from wasps  Usually
less hairy than bees  wasps are known for their
very narrow "waists” between the thorax and
abdomen  They do not make honey or wax  and
they have smooth stingers  which means they can
sting over and over without dying 
The wasps we most often encounter are the
social wasps creatures that live in groups such
as hornets  Vespa   yellow jackets  Vespula   and
paper wasps  Polistes   All of them make different
types of papery nests  sometimes in troublesome
places  such as on door hinges  inside porch
lights  or under tables  Disturb a well developed
nest  and you could get zapped 
Solitary wasps critters that live alone can
also sting in self defense  but they mainly use
their venom to paralyze spiders or insects  Like
bees  these wasps feed largely on nectar when
they are adults  As babies  they need a lot more
protein  and that means meat 
The great golden digger wasp  Sphex ichneumoneus 
will sting prey  such as a katydid  and then
drag the victim into its burrow nest in the ground 
The tarantula hawk  aka tarantula wasp  example:
Pepsis formosa   a desert species  will attack a tarantula
many times its size  paralyze the spider  and
manage to lug it to the spider's nest  or sometimes
the wasp's own burrow  This wasp's sting is especially
painful to people  though not lethal 
A potter wasp  Eumenes  or a mud dauber
wasp  Trypoxylon politum  carries its prey a spider
or insect  depending on the wasp species 
into its pot or pipe shaped clay nest  which is
often found on buildings  Then  the wasp lays an
egg  generally on the prey  When the egg hatches 
the larva eats the meat  The
paralyzed  but still living prey
is not only high in protein  but
also fresh 

hornet 
paper wasp
potter wasp


it ain't an ant
It looks like a hairy ant  It crawls on the
ground like a hairy ant  But the velvet ant
 example: Dasymutilla occidentalis  is actually a
solitary wasp  Males are winged  but females are
wingless  In most species  females parasitize
other solitary wasps  as well as solitary bees 
They enter their victims' nests  open the cells
where the larvae are developing  and lay eggs on
them so their youngsters can hatch and feed on
these insects 
Adult velvet ants drink mostly nectar  They
are not aggressive creatures  They try to run
from enemies  and they make squeaking sounds
when disturbed  In America  the velvet ant's
painful venomous sting has earned it the nickname
“cow killer ” although it really can't kill
any cattle 
In Africa  two species of velvet ants parasitize
tsetse flies  Glossina   which carry sleeping sickness 
a serious disease that affects horses  cattle 
and people  Scientists hope that velvet ants may
someday be used as the biological control of these
harmful flies

Although there are many species of solid colored
wasps and bees  when we think of these
insects  we think of flashy stripes: orange and black
or yellow and black  These colors and patterns are
aposematic they warn enemies that these critters
are venomous  Once a bird  amphibian  or other
predator attempts to sample a stinging wasp or
bee  it will hesitate to try another  The sacrifice of
a few insects ensures the survival of many more 


Aposematism is a useful device  So is mimicry 
animals imitating other animals  Some nonvenomous
creatures imitate venomous ones  Wasps
and bees have many stingless mimics  Several of
these copycats  such as the American hover fly
 Metasyrphus americanus  and its relatives  use
their colors to protect themselves from being
eaten by birds and reptiles  Certain robber flies
 example: Dasyllis haemorrhoa  look just like honeybees
so they can stalk and eat the bees  But if
you examine these mimics  you'll see that  like all
flies  they have one pair of wings instead of the
two pairs that bees and wasps possess 
Other garden insects' warning colors announce
that they are poisonous to eat  The poison is generally
not strong enough to kill predators  It makes
more sense for the survival of a species to sicken 
not slaughter enemies so they'll learn to avoid this
prey in the future 
The most familiar of these aposematic insects
are two garden favorites: the orange and black
ladybug  example: Coccinella septempunctata  
which is a type of beetle  and the monarch butterfly
 Danaus plexippus  
Who doesn't
like ladybugs?
Aphids because
ladybugs eat them 
But neither do
many frogs  toads 
birds  and lizards 
Ladybugs taste terrible!
If the beetle's
warning coloration
isn't enough to deter a
hunter  it will reflex bleed  which means it will ooze
yellowish blood from its leg joints  The fluid contains
toxins and has a bad odor  A predator will
quickly realize by smell  taste  or both that a ladybug
is bad eats 
The monarch butterfly feeds on nectar from
a variety of flowers  But in its caterpillar stage  it
eats only toxic milkweed leaves and  as a result  it
too becomes toxic and remains toxic  right into
adulthood  Birds and other beings that taste this
butterfly learn from its Halloween colors that they
don't want a second bite

pretty poison

Other butterflies and their
close relatives also become poisonous
from their diet  Among these
are various species of tiger moths
of the Arctiidae family  many of
which are aposematic  If they are
touched  some secrete poisonous
foam from glands in their thorax 
Spiders and other predators will avoid these insects  It's a good
idea for people to avoid touching these foaming flyers  too  as
the froth of certain species can burn human skin 
Rattlebox moths  Utetheisa ornatrix  are members of the
frothing tiger moth clan  The females get a unique wedding
present from the males  The female moths are born toxic  but
as they reach reproductive age  they
need more toxins to protect their many
eggs from certain wasps that attack
them  During mating  males transmit
this extra poison to the females  and
the females  in turn  pass it to the eggs 


nasty hairy caterpillars

Insects are popular prey  so they've had to develop
many forms of protection in order to survive  and that
means quite a few are bound to be toxic  Some  like the
monarchs and the tiger moths  are poisonous  Others 
such as the io moth  Automeris io  and saddleback caterpillars
 Sibine stimulea   are urticating insects with spines
that easily break off  And in their case  the spines contain
toxins that pour out to irritate predators  making human
skin itch and burn 
The spines of the cute puss moth caterpillar
 Megalopyge opercularis  are covered with a thick coat
of reddish brown hairs  This caterpillar's toxins are the
most severe  Besides getting a skin rash  its victims may
experience headaches  nausea  weakness  and shock 
Adult moths don't have venomous spines  but the
females of some species will gather the spines from their
own cast off caterpillar skins and use them to cover and
protect their eggs with a cozy  toxic quilt!

monarch butterfly
viceroy butterfly
i'm the king  no I'm the king
monarchs and other toxic butterflies have many mimics one well known monarch
imitator is the viceroy butterfly limenitis archippus for years entomologists 
insect scientists thought the viceroy was not toxic that it was just fooling 
predators into thinking it was. this type of mimicry is called
batesian mimicry but entomologists now believe that viceroys too are toxic
in the tropical americans poisonous passion vine butterflies heliconius which feed
on the cyanide laced nectar and pollen from passion flowers also have toxic mimics 
when a toxic species imitates another toxic species it's called mullerian mimicry
what's the point of this form of imitation birds and other predators have to learn 
just one pattern then they will leave all the toxic animals with that pattern alone

hands off these insects too
Blister beetles
 example: Epicauta
fabricii  will eat
your flowers or
your vegetables 
but predators can't
eat them  They're
poisonous  If you
handle them  some species will ooze the toxic
substance  cantharidin  from their legs  This
chemical will raise blisters on your skin  but the
same toxin is used in ointments to cure warts!
Some animals  such as hedgehogs  frogs  and
a variety of spiders  can tolerate cantharidin  One
insect that's known to thrive on it is the fire colored
beetle  Neopyrochroa flabellata  It eats the
chemical to protect itself from predators  A male
will secrete some
between its eyes
and offer this
toxic treat to a
female  If she
accepts his gift 
he'll transmit another load of cantharidin when
they mate  Like the rattlebox moth  the female
fire colored beetle then passes on the poison to
her eggs 
Some assassin bugs can stomach monarch
butterflies  Some eat other insects  And a few
feast on human blood  As their name suggests 
they hunt very quickly  All assassin bugs have a
sharp  curved rostrum 
or beak  to
pierce their prey 
Within the rostrum
are several
fused stylets needle 
like tubes that
are used to inject
venom  which paralyzes and liquefies the victim 
and then to suck up the prey  One species  the
wheel bug  Arilus cristatus   has such fast acting
venom that  once bitten  a caterpillar more than
four hundred times this predator's weight can die
in just ten seconds 
Some assassin bugs
can pierce human skin 
The wheel bug's bite
is said to be the most
painful of any insect 
But it isn't eager to
bite you  More dangerous is another species 
the bloodsucking conenose  Triatoma sanguisuga 
found in Central and South America  where it
enters homes to feed on human blood  It is nicknamed
the "kissing bug ” because it can painlessly
pierce a victim's lips  eyelids  or ears  What makes
it dangerous is not its venom  but Chagas disease 
that can be transmitted through its feces  which
it sometimes deposits on the person it bites  This
illness may result in heart and digestive problems
and even death 



the most dangerous insect of all 

The most dangerous insect perhaps the most dangerous
animal in the world has no stinger or spines  In fact  it's not
venomous or poisonous at all  yet it sickens or kills 700 000 000
people worldwide each year  and countless other animals  as
well  What is this scary creature? A female mosquito  example:
Anopheles punctipennis  
There are many species of mosquitoes  All of them develop
in water or moisture  The larvae hatch from eggs  grow  pupate 
and emerge a week later as adults  Males feed on nectar  Females
also feed on nectar  but most need blood to produce eggs  and
they don't care where it comes from a lion  a deer  a robin  a
poodle  or you 
They find their victims by sensing body heat  sweat  and carbon
dioxide  given off when we breathe  They use their sharp 
needle like proboscis tubular mouth with fused stylets to
inject saliva that contains anticoagulants  substances to keep the
victim's blood from clotting  and to draw up that blood 
Through its saliva  mosquitoes can transmit a host of diseases
and parasites  including yellow fever  malaria  West Nile fever 
encephalitis  and heartworms  Not all mosquitoes cause disease 
but their itchy bites can make our days and nights miserable 
So what are mosquitoes good for? Food! That may not
please you  but it does please bats  dragonflies  frogs  toads  and
many other animals  both toxic and non toxic  that feast on
these whining flies

femme fatale fireflies
fireflies are magical signs of summer
they use their famous lights to find mates the males and females of each species
use specific patterns to talk to each other 
fireflies are also poisonous or rather the photinus species are
their rear ends produce not only their light making chemicals but also 
compounds called lucibufagins which are toxic to a whole host of animals including 
spiders lizards and toads
now here's where it gets weird. female fireflies of the photuris species can't produce their 
own lucibufagins. so how do they get them  they pretend to be photinus babes flashing their 
signal at photinus males when a male takes the bait the female photuris kills and eats him 
acquiring toxins his then she is protected against predators

a field day for ants ant colony

What's a picnic without sandwiches  chips 
lemonade  and       venom? Who's bringing the
toxins? Ants  of course 
Ants are members of the same order as bees
and wasps  But while some bees and wasps are
solitary  ants  on the other hand  are always
social  Their nests are found underground  in
trees  and in buildings  Some species live in large 
well ordered colonies that may number in the
millions  Colonies may even join together to
form super colonies  covering a wide area of land 
Female workers are wingless  Males and young
queens have wings  and  among many colonies
during mating season  they fly out to establish
new nests and colonies  Then the wings drop off
or are pulled off 
Ants are found in grasslands  as well as
deserts  temperate woodlands  and rainforests 
Most of them are harmless  such as the little
black ants monomorium minimum that invade our picnics
and our houses for food but some species use their rear ends
to sting or spray and nobody wants to picnic around them

ants that sting


In America  the nastiest of these stingers may
well be imported fire ants  Solenopsis invicta and
Solenopsis richteri   Fire ants arrived in the   
by hitching rides on ships from South America 
They build big mound nests  two feet wide and
up to three feet high  in fields and lawns  They
are especially fond of golf courses  Worker ants
exit from tunnels that can extend as much as ten
yards from the mound  They are omnivorous
and will use their venom to paralyze or kill many
kinds of small ground nesting animals for food 
They also aggressively defend their nests 
When an enemy threatens  a fire ant will clamp
on with its jaws and spin in a circle  stinging
over and over with its rear end  A single fire ant's
stings cause itchy  burning blisters  but they're
usually not deadly  However  when one ant
stings  its alarm pheromone alerts the other ants 
which come rushing out of the ground  No animal
wants to face a whole colony of two hundred
thousand stinging ants!

red harvester ant

Some people confuse red harvester ants  Pogonomyrmex
barbatus   the native American species usually sold for ant
farms  with fire ants  They can also sting  but they are non aggressive
and non invasive they don't take over other
species' habitats  In fact  they are being driven out by the
imported fire ants in parts of the country  The decline of
this species has led  in part  to the decline of its predator 
the Texas horned lizard  In addition  the lizard and its eggs
are the prey of the fire ants 
Imported fire ants have invaded other countries  too 
Australia is currently doing battle with these pests  This
continent already has its share of fierce stingers  including
the bulldog or jumping ants  Myrmecia   known for
their huge jaws and savage grip  Along with the fire ants 
the bulldog ants have surely ruined more than one picnic 
However  recent studies suggest that their toxins may also
hold the key to lowering high blood pressure  So perhaps
some picnickers will forgive them 



Ants are social not only near their nests  Sometimes they
travel together to hunt and no group of marching ants forms
a scarier image than the army ants  Eciton burchelli  of South
and Central America  They migrate regularly to find new
camping and hunting grounds  For two or three nights  in
groups of one hundred thousand to two million  they march 
moving in organized patterns  attacking animals in their path 
First  they sting their victims  and then they tear them apart
with jaws so powerful that native Central American people
have used the ants as sutures to hold wounds together until
they healed 
Army ants mostly eat insects and spiders about fifty
thousand in a single day but they have been known to attack
mice  rats  snakes  birds  and even large mammals  Their victims
often die of shock 
Do these ants devour people? No  No matter what you see
in Hollywood movies  people can easily step aside and watch
the ants pass a parade that may take hours  Even when the
ants enter houses  the human inhabitants can just take their
livestock and leave and thank the ants for clearing their
homes of vermin  The truth is that these insects are threatened
by people rather than vice versa  as we claim more and
more of their habitat for human use 


phorid fly with fire ants

fire ant foes
in south america many species of anteaters and armadillos eat fire ants in the american 
southwest we have only one type of armadillo to do the job but even if we had more species
armadillos alone can't conquer these insects it takes a bug to eliminate a bug
female phorid flies pseudacteon are attracted to fire ants swarming over a disturbed mound
each fly selects an individual ant and attacks it in flight injecting an egg into the 
ant's thorax with its hook like ovipositor the larva hatches and moves through 
the ant's body and into its head killing its host

originally from brazil and argentina where they keep down the fire ant population phorid flies are 
being carefully and experimentally released at various sites in the so far they seem to destroy
nothing but the ants since fire ant mounds are disturbed armadillos this combination of a mammal
and a fly may prove a powerful force against these stingers and a blessing to 
american picnickers and golfers

bullhorn acacia ant
together wherever we sting
a symbiotic relationship is one that benefits two species that live together sometimes those two 
species are both animals but sometimes as in the case of the bullhorn acacia acacia cornigera
and the bullhorn acacia ant pseudomyrmex ferruginea one is a tree and the other is an animal
most acacia trees have bitter chemicals in their leaves to protect them from being eaten bullhorn
acacias don't what they have instead are ants living in their hollow thorns the trees provide special
food for the ants and the ants provide defense for the trees rushing out to sting any creatures that 
want to feast on the foliage

Jason Schmidt has been stung by almost every bee  wasp  and ant
in the world  so he created the "Schmidt Sting Pain Index” to describe the
type and severity of the pain from different kinds of stings  According to
Schmidt  the bullhorn acacia ant's sting is worse than the fire ant's  the
red harvester's is more painful than the acacia ant's  and the bullet ant's is
the mother of all stings!
Folks who have been stung by Central and South American bullet
ants  Paraponera clavata  say the sensation is like being shot by a bullet 
and the severe pain  accompanied by trembling of the injured limb  can
last for a whole day  In the past  certain South American native people
used these ants in initiation ceremonies  Boys would intentionally be
stung by the insects  To prove that they were men  they had to show no
sign of pain  That's a tough way to say "I'm a grown up ”


Wood ants  Formica   found on
forest floors  and carpenter ants
 Camponotus   which live in dead
trees and also buildings  are not
stingers they're sprayers  A spraying
ant will grab hold of its prey or
enemy with its jaws  Then  depending
on the species  it will either tuck
its abdomen under its legs or raise it
over its back and squirt formic acid 
This pungent toxic liquid is powerful
stuff  It can repel and even kill animals  But
spraying ants usually won't spray unless they're
also biting  An ant predator called the antlion
 Myrmeleon  can capture and feed on these ants
while preventing them from spraying 
Some species of antlions dig a shallow coneshaped
pit in sand  The antlion then waits at
the bottom of the trap for its prey to fall in and
attacks before the ant has a chance to bite  and
therefore spray  It usually helps the prey slide
down the tunnel by flipping sand at the ant with
its huge jaws and head  Antlions are also called
“doodlebugs” because they make artistic looking
trails in the sand as they search for the best place
to dig their pit

Formic acid can also kill plants  In the Amazon
rainforest there are areas in which all but one species
of plants are dead  They're called "devil's gardens ”
Some native people believed that evil spirits tended
these gardens  Scientists have recently discovered
that these spirits are none other than ants lemon
ants  Myrmelachista schumanni   to be precise  They
colonize certain trees  which they prefer for their
hollow stems  and spray formic acid as an herbicide
to rid their territory of competing plants  One lemon
ant garden is more than a third of an acre in size and
approximately eight hundred years old 
In the early twentieth century  yellow crazy ants
 Anoplolepis gracilipes  were accidentally introduced
on Christmas Island in the Pacific Ocean  Thanks to
their formic acid  these insects  named for their frantic
movements when disturbed  changed the island's
entire ecosystem 
Land crabs used to migrate in great numbers
across the land  When they moved through areas
infested with the yellow crazy ants  the ants thought
the crabs were enemies  The insects sprayed so much
formic acid that fifteen to twenty million crabs were
blinded and then killed  Seedlings and weeds that
used to be eaten by the crabs thrived  displacing other
animals and plants  The parks service there has now
succeeded in finding a poison that destroys the ants
but doesn't harm any other animals  and the island's
ecological balance is being restored 

Crawling through fields  meadows  and dry
grasslands called savannahs is another group of biters
and sprayers  To many people  they're the scariest
animals of all  They are snakes 
Snakes live in a wide variety of habitats besides
savannahs deserts  rainforests  woodlands  and even
your backyard  They come in many colors and
lengths  but none of them are slimy  They are reptiles 
cold blooded animals with backbones and dry 
scaly skin  Some snakes  like other reptiles  lay eggs 
others bear live young  All are carnivorous 
It was formerly believed that of the nearly three
thousand species of snakes  only three hundred were
venomous  But recent research indicates that most
snakes can produce venom although the majority
are too small or too shy or are physically unable to
inject the venom into us

formic acid isn't something you'd want to put on your skin but many species of birds
use it on their feathers some such as jays starlings and crows sit on anthills and let the ants
swarm over them or actively pic up ants and rub them on their bodies no one is sure why 
birds practice anting it is possible that the formic acid kills fleas lice and other insects that 
pester the birds. another theory is that once the ants discharge their formic acid they're a 
tasty snack for the birds
snake in the grass alas
a nonvenomous garter snake
a venomous copperhead snake

Dr  Bryan Fry  biologist at the University
of Melbourne  Australia  says it was venom 
He believes that it existed two hundred million
years ago one hundred million years before the
first snakes appeared  A common ancestor of
snakes and lizards had venom  which it dispensed
through its upper and lower jaws  As snakes
evolved  each family developed its own venom 
a brew of old and new toxins  delivered only
through teeth in their upper jaws 
The earliest venomous snakes most likely had
enlarged  grooved rear teeth that were located
below glands that secreted toxic saliva to help subdue
prey  These reptiles were the opisthoglyphs 
the rear fanged snakes  Then  according to one
theory  the snakes' jaws got smaller  and the rear
fangs moved to the front of their mouths  The
grooves deepened and connected to form short 
fixed hollow tubes  And the proteroglyphs front fanged
snakes appeared  Eventually these fangs
lengthened  In fact  they became so long that
snakes could not close their mouths unless they
could also fold their fangs  and so the solenoglyphs
 the vipers evolved 
Because snake skeletons are fragile  fossil evidence
is inconclusive  Newer methods of investigation
using DNA may reveal more information
about snake evolution 


Ophidiphobia  It means"fear of snakes ” People
acquire it from parents  other relatives  friends  television 
and movies  Or do they? Some scientists think
humans have been programmed for millions of years
to fear these reptiles  They believe that our mammalian
ancestors  who lived in a time when reptiles
dominated the world  developed a healthy respect for
these critters  and that they genetically passed the
fear along to us 
It's true that about fifty thousand people currently
die each year from snakebites  But it's also true that
as much as we fear snakes  they fear us a lot more 
Most are not aggressive  and they prefer to crawl
away from  not toward  us  Sad to say  these fascinating
animals are persecuted and also hunted for their
skins  No wonder they've developed anthropophobia

answers 
constrictors
venomous snakes number is actually a lizard and number is a fish were you fooled
a diamondback rattlesnake is a front fanged species


Not all snakes use venom to kill their victims 
Some snakes use constriction they seize the prey
with their small  backward pointing teeth  then
quickly wrap themselves around the victim and
tighten their muscles to suffocate it  The most
famous of these constrictors are the pythons and
boas 
Like the constrictors  venomous snakes have
“regular” teeth to seize prey and to prevent it
from slipping out of their mouths  but they also
have a pair of hollow fangs in their upper jaws to
inject toxins  If a snake loses a fang  another one
usually replaces it  sometimes as often as once a
week  Baby venomous snakes are born with fangs
and the ability to inject venom  They will shed
teeth and fangs many times during their lives 
Some snakes bite and hold their prey  chewing
to inject venom deep in the wound  Others
strike and quickly withdraw  As for a snake's
forked tongue  it cannot sting it is used to taste
smell the air to find food 
Snake venom has to work quickly and efficiently
to subdue prey  That's why it is so potent 
A struggling victim is dangerous not only when
it is caught  but also when it is swallowed  It
could easily break the snake's ribs or skull  So the
snake waits until the prey is paralyzed  tracks it
by smell  and then swallows it  A snake's jaws are
connected by stretchy skin and ligaments so it can
open its mouth very wide  The two sides of the
jaws work independently "walking” the prey to
the rear of the snake's mouth and down its throat



A snake's venom is actually modified saliva 
It is produced in special glands below and
behind the snake's eyes  and it flows into tissues
surrounding the base of the fangs  and
then into the fangs' venom canals  It is mostly
made up of proteins in the form of enzymes
that help break down the prey quickly  In one
study  a venomous snake called a fer de lance
 Bothrops asper  found in Central and South
American rainforests  clearings  and fields had
its venom removed  Instead of the two or three
days the snake usually needed to digest a rat  it
took this snake twelve days 
Studies of Bothrops venom have also resulted
in the discovery of beta blockers drugs used
to treat cardiovascular diseases  In fact  snake
venom components are used in many areas of
medicine  From cobra venom  scientists have
developed several painkillers  Other venoms
have produced anticoagulants that prevent blood
clots  Venoms are currently being investigated
for their potential to kill harmful viruses and
bacteria and to treat other cardiovascular 
nerve  muscular  and joint diseases  as well as
visual disorders 

Today  all three categories of
venomous snakes are still around 
the rear fanged and the two front fanged
types  fixed and folding 
and they're found in grasslands  as
well as many other habitats  all over
the world 
Rear fanged snakes inject venom
as they "chew” their prey  They include
the Asian forest dwelling green vine
snake  Ahaetulla nasuta  and the
African boomslang  Dispholidus typus 
of the savannahs  Most rear fanged snakes are not
as dangerous to humans as front fanged snakes 
Among the front fanged snakes with fixed
fangs are kraits  sea snakes  brown snakes  taipans 
mambas  death adders  and the famous
cobras  All of these snakes can bite  but some
cobras are also known for their ability to shoot
venom through openings in their fangs  They
are the spitting cobras  example: Naja nigricollis
nigricincta   many of which are found on
the savannahs and grasslands of
Africa and Asia  The openings in
their fangs are somewhat shorter
and rounder than those of nonspitters 
Spitting cobras spray only in
self defense  When a cobra is about
to spurt  it rises up  spreads its hood 
and aims with great accuracy at an
enemy's eyes  The spray can travel more
than ten feet to blind the attacker 
People who have been sprayed need
to flush out their eyes with water immediately to
prevent damage  Some scientists believe that this
spraying behavior developed as the snakes' way
of avoiding being trampled by antelopes  which
share the same territory 
To catch prey  a spitting cobra does not spit 
It injects neurotoxic venom with its fixed fangs 
just like its non spitting  twelve to eighteen foot
cousin  the Asian king cobra  Ophiophagus hannah  
the longest venomous snake in the world 

Cobra venom is very strong indeed  but other fixed fang
snakes have even more powerful venoms  These include the
sea snakes  example: Aipysurus laevis   found in the Pacific
and Indian oceans  and the Australian desert dwelling inland
taipan  Oxyuranus microlepidotus   The venom in one bite of
an inland taipan  also called the fierce snake  can kill two
hundred thousand mice  or approximately sixty two humans 
However  none of these species are aggressive  and they are
less likely to encounter people than cobras or terrestrial  land based 
kraits  example: Bungarus fasciatus   which sometimes
enter people's homes and are responsible for a great number
of envenomations and some deaths

 The man in the turban sits cross legged on the ground  In
front of him is a closed basket  He removes the lid and begins to
play the flute  From the basket  a cobra begins to rise  The snake
spreads its hood and sways to and fro to the tune  Then  as if on
cue  the snake charmer stops playing and the snake disappears
back into its container  Hypnosis? Magic? Biology!
When the basket cover is removed  the snake is startled by
the sudden light and by the charmer waving his flute overhead 
It rises defensively  following the movement of the flute with
its body  It cannot hear the tune because all snakes are deaf 
but it may feel the vibrations  Its "dance” is threatening  but it
doesn't attack because it prefers to scare off a possible predator
rather than fight or bite  Furthermore  it can't strike upwards 
only downwards  and the charmer is probably out of striking
range anyway  If it does strike  the charmer doesn't usually suffer
severely  perhaps because he has become immune to the
venom or because the snake has delivered a dry bite  When the
charmer stops waving the flute  the snake no longer needs its
threat display  and it retreats to safety and darkness 
Snake charming was once promoted in India and other countries
for tourism  But animal rights groups have had an impact on
the practice  Most snake charmers treat their animals well  but others
are cruel to these reptiles  They remove the venom glands or
fangs or even sew shut the snakes' mouths  Today  snake charming
is no longer legal  but the Indian government and animal rights
groups  along with the charmers  are examining the possibility of
the snake handlers becoming reptile rescuers and educators  as
well as practitioners who treat cases of snakebite 


Besides the inland taipan and its cousin 
the common taipan  Oxyuranus scutellatus
scutellatus   Australia is home to
some of the other most venomous snakes
in the world  One is the death adder
 example: Acanthophis antarcticus   which
tends to stay put when prey  or people 
approach  Others include the timid tiger
snake  Notechis scutatus  and the eastern
brown snake  Pseudonaja textilis   which
can be found in pastures and farmlands 
among other habitats  The latter has
been responsible for the most deaths by
snakebite in that country but  thanks to
antivenin  that number has been greatly
reduced to one or two per year 
The brown snake's venom is twelve
times more powerful than a cobra's  and
it has a fascinating ingredient: a procoagulant 
an agent that causes big blood clots
to form  After a serious accident or during
surgery  it's essential to get blood to clot
quickly  Scientists believe that they can
eventually create a spray made from the
brown snake's procoagulant that can stop
bleeding  It seems that this reptile's future
is to save rather than take human lives 


In Africa  another dangerous fixed fang
snake  which sometimes finds its way into
folks' homes  is the savannah dwelling black
mamba  Dendroaspis polylepis   It hunts during
the day and is one of the world's fastest moving
snakes  It is at home on both the
ground and in the trees  often at the level
of a person's head  and it sometimes enters
abodes to search for food  It does not seek to
bite people  but it will strike to protect itself
and its home 
Mamba venom is particularly strong 
containing both neuro  and cardiotoxins
that affect the nerves and the heart  As little
as two drops of its venom can kill a human 
and mambas can have as many as twenty
drops in their fangs  Fortunately  an available
antivenin has significantly reduced the number
of human deaths caused by mamba bites 



 Many animals prey on young snakes  Some  including people  even
feed on full grown reptiles   Some folks claim that snake meat tastes
like chicken   The mongoose   Herpestes   eats a variety of foods  but it
is famous for killing African and Asian cobras  This mammal is fast and
agile  and its sharp teeth can break a snake's spine  Its thick fur protects
it from snakebite  and  though it is not immune to the venom  it probably
has a high tolerance to it 
The secretary bird   Sagittarius serpentarius   also has a varied diet 
but it is known as the foe of mambas and other terrestrial African snakes 
Named for the feathers on its head that resemble the quill pens that
secretaries used to stick behind their ears many years ago  this bird of
prey walks up to twenty miles a day in search of food  When it finds a
snake  the bird grabs the reptile with its strong toes and stamps on it or
beats it to death on the ground  while protecting itself from bites with
its large wings 
Snakes feed on other snakes  too  The king cobra is a snake eater 
So is the American king snake   Example: Lampropeltis getula    found in
a wide range of habitats from swamps to deserts  It kills by constriction
and is immune to venom  so it can feed on venomous snakes  along with
other delicacies  such as lizards  small mammals  and eggs  King snakes
have been known to
swallow rattlesnakes
equal to their own
length  That's one
large meal!


Vipers are the folding fang snakes  In Asia  a
deadly grassland biter is the Russell's viper  Daboia
russelii   It is responsible for thousands of deaths
throughout its range  The Russell's viper is an abundant
species that often lives in rice fields  so farmers
are sometimes bitten when the rice is being planted
and harvested  The toxins affect the kidneys and
prevent blood from clotting 
But getting rid of snakes from these fields isn't
a good answer  History has shown that in places
where snakes have been eliminated  populations of
rodents and other vermin explode  and crops  stored
grains  and other food get destroyed  Rodents are
also carriers of many diseases  so snakes are a good
biological control to prevent epidemics 
In both Asia and Africa  one of the most feared
terrestrial snakes is the saw scaled viper  Echis carinatus  
also known as a carpet viper  According to
The Guinness Book of World Records  this species is
responsible for more human deaths than any other
snake nearly fifty people per million each year 
Found in a wide variety of environments  this
viper has scales on its sides that resemble saw teeth 
It warns enemies by rubbing the scales together 
making a loud hissing sound like an air leak  The
saw scaled viper is known for its nervous nature 
which makes it quicker to attack than most other
snakes  Its potent venom is both neurotoxic and
hemotoxic 


In the     more people are bitten by copperheads
 Agkistrodon contortrix  than by other
venomous snakes  These terrestrial vipers are
the most common venomous snakes in America
and are widespread  They live in grassy fields 
forests  mountains  and dry lands  as well as
by streams and waterways often near homes
and towns  But because their fangs are short
and their venom is mild  copperheads kill few
people 
In fact  copperheads may soon save many
lives  Scientists have isolated a protein called
contortrostatin in their venom  which shows
great promise in stopping both the growth and
spread of breast and other cancers 
Fortunately  few people die of snakebites 
period  because the venom is meant for much
smaller animals  Like spiders  venomous snakes
often give people"dry” bites with no venom 
they don't want to waste it on animals they can't
eat  However  even if you're not a rat or a sparrow 
it's still smart to let that snake in the grass
quietly pass 


A lizard that spends much of its time underground to
escape the desert heat  the Gila monster  Heloderma suspectum 
must come out to feed  And when it does  this lizard grabs
hold with its teeth and hangs on like a pit bull  Its painful
bite can kill its prey or make a larger enemy like you feel
dizzy and weak 
The Gila monster has grooved teeth that are connected to
venom glands in its lower jaw  It needs to hold onto a victim
and chew in order to deliver its neurotoxic venom  This is a
slow method  so scientists believe that the lizard's venom is
mainly for self defense  rather than predation  It is rarely  if
ever  fatal to people 
In fact  the venom is now being used to help some people
who have diabetes  a disorder in which the body can't control
blood sugar because it doesn't produce or properly use the
hormone insulin  Patients with this disease sometimes have
to inject themselves with the hormone  The problem with
injected insulin is that it can make the blood sugar level too
low instead of too high  Though the Gila monster eats one big
meal and then fasts for months  its blood sugar always stays at


the same level  This fact led
Dr  John Eng to investigate the
reptile's venom and to discover
a hormone that forces blood cells
to deal with sugar overload  but
stops working when the right sugar
level is reached  It also helps diabetics
lose weight  The Gila monster drug is
already on the market and proving to be highly
successful  Dr  Eng and millions of diabetics are
giving thanks to one beautiful lizard 
For a long time  the Gila monster  found in
the Mojave  Sonoran  and Chihuahuan deserts 
and its Latin American cousin  the Mexican
beaded lizard  Heloderma horridum  were thought
to be the only venomous lizards in the world 
People who have been bitten by other lizards
often develop pain  swelling  and prolonged
bleeding  but scientists used to think that the
cause was the bacteria in the lizards' mouths 
However  Dr  Bryan Fry's recent research suggests
that forest dwelling iguanas  Iguana  and
monitor lizards  Varanus   such as the largest
lizard of all  the Komodo dragon  Varanus komodoensis 
of Indonesia  also produce venom  but
not in quantities sufficient to harm us seriously 
Perhaps the venom is responsible for some of the
painful bites or perhaps it is a combination of
venom and bacteria 



Lizards don't have fangs to inject venom
quickly and efficiently  but desert rattlesnakes
 Crotalus  do  Like copperheads  rattlesnakes
are pit vipers they have heat sensing openings
between their eyes and nostrils to detect prey  In
addition  like many snakes  they use camouflage
to hide from prey  But camouflage can be a problem
when big enemies appear  So these snakes
shake their rattles to warn horses  cattle  people 
and other large animals not to step on them  If the
rattling doesn't work  then they strike  injecting
hemotoxic venom that destroys tissues and organs
and disrupts blood clotting  It isn't true that they
must coil into an shape to strike  and they can
lunge almost faster than the human eye can see 
Many snakes lay eggs  but rattlers give birth to
live young  The babies have short fangs  but are
venomous and dangerous perhaps even more
dangerous than adults  They don't have rattles to
warn enemies  so when disturbed  they immediately
become defensive and may strike repeatedly 
Though they produce less venom  it appears to
have a higher concentration of toxins  In addition 
young snakes haven't yet learned what is and is not
a serious threat  and they tend to deliver a full
dose rather than a dry bite 
Rattlesnake bites from babies or adults are
always serious  and sometimes fatal  though antivenins
have significantly reduced deaths from
them 
Rattlesnakes have many non venomous mimics 
Gopher snakes  Pituophis melanoleuces   rat
snake   Elaphe  and racers  Example: Coluber
constrictor  vibrate their rattle less tails in dry
grass or leaves to make rattle like sounds  From
their underground homes  burrowing owls  Athene
cunicularia  make rattling hisses that have fooled
folks into thinking they're reptiles  not birds 
Snakes and lizards are found in a wide variety
of habitats  but they are often associated with the
desert  So are tarantulas and scorpions 



Deserts are regions with very little rainfall 
They cover one fifth of the earth's surface  Some
are cool places that may even have snowfall in
winter  but we're most familiar with the deserts
that are hot  such as the American Mojave or the
African Sahara  Because of the burning  shifting
sands  it's hard for animals to travel across the
desert  One type of rattlesnake that has found
a solution is the American sidewinder  Crotalus
cerastes   This species of rattlesnake loops sideways
over the dunes  with just two spots of its
body touching the sand at any one time  Using
this unique locomotion  the sidewinder can move
quickly to prey on rodents  lizards  and sometimes
birds  leaving a series of  shaped tracks in
the sand 
Sidewinders have"horns” scales that stick
out over their eyes to protect them from grit as
they enter their underground burrows  Some
Saharan and other desert snakes also have these
horns and use the side winding motion to travel 

Scorpions are nocturnal arachnids that glow
in the dark  They use their pincers to grab insects 
worms  lizards  mice  and other scorpions  They
inject neurotoxic venom into their prey  as well
as their enemies  with stingers on their rear ends 
Recent research indicates that some  and perhaps
all  scorpions  example: Parabuthus transvaalicus 
have a thick venom and a thinner prevenom 
Venom is made up mostly of protein  and it
requires a lot energy to produce  Scorpions need
venom to subdue larger  more dangerous prey or
to escape from enemies that won't leave them
alone  Prevenom has less protein and requires less
energy to make  It works against smaller  nonthreatening
species and it causes greater pain  A
mouse that receives a dose of prevenom will jump
around  then stop to nurse its injected limb  giving
the scorpion a chance to get away  Scientists
now want to study other venomous animals to see
if they  too  produce prevenom 
Eons ago some scorpions were huge three
feet long! Now the largest one  the emperor scorpion
 Pandinus imperator  of North Africa  is only
eight inches long still big  but not gigantic  But
these large emperors rarely sting people  In fact 
they are sometimes kept as pets and unfortunately 
over collecting is responsible for their
decline in the wild 


Far more dangerous to people are the two inch 
long bark scorpions  Centruroides exilicauda  
the only deadly scorpion species in the    
and the two  to four inch long Sahara scorpions
 example: Androctonus australis   which are probably
the deadliest scorpions in the world  Scorpions
with big  strong pincers  such as the emperors 
usually rely on grabbing and eating their prey
instead of envenoming it first  The deadly species
have narrower and weaker pincers 
Despite their venom  scorpions are eaten by
lizards  mongooses  burrowing owls  and other
animals  These predators bite or break off the
scorpion's metasoma first  This just goes to prove
that in the desert and everywhere else poison
only works if you get a chance to use it 

 Scientists and other folks who are interested in
scorpions can find them at night in their natural habitats
by using handheld black lights that produce ultraviolet
 UV  light  When exposed to this light  scorpions
fluoresce   A thin  transparent film called hyaline  found
in their cuticle  the outermost layer of their exoskeleton 
contains a special protein that allows them to
glow green blue or green yellow in the dark  When
scorpions molt  shed their exoskeleton as they grow 
they do not glow until their new cuticle hardens 
Why do  they glow? Scientists are not sure  One
theory is that scorpions can see fluorescence without
the aid of UV light and  therefore  they can find or avoid
each other  But some scientists doubt the ability of
these arachnids to see the glow  Another theory is that
there are other nocturnal predators capable of detecting
this fluorescence  allowing them to spot and stay
away from these venomous arachnids 


Doctors have created a synthetic version of a
protein found in the venom of the giant yellow
Israeli scorpion or death stalker  Leiurus quinquestriatus 
to fight a type of brain tumor  The
protein can deliver radioactive iodine  a chemotherapy
agent  directly to the cancerous cells to
kill them while leaving the healthy cells alone  It
might also have cancer fighting properties itself 
As one doctor said "Using radioactive scorpion
venom sounds like science fiction ” but it is actually
science fact! Medical trials are so promising
that doctors now want to see if the protein works
against other tumors  as well 


Toad tadpoles  Some insects will eat them 
but many other animals won't  Why? Because
they're poisonous 
Toads  example: Bufo americanus  are amphibians 
cold blooded animals with backbones that
are generally born in moist places  They live in
forests and deserts  as well as in and near freshwater
ponds and streams  As tadpoles  or larvae 
amphibians need gills to breathe  and then they
develop into adults with lungs and legs  Some
species spend their entire lives in water  Others 
such as many types of toads  are more terrestrial 
But they still
need to lay their
eggs in ponds
and other damp
areas 



What is the difference between a frog and a
toad? Technically  toads are frogs  and it is often
hard to distinguish one from another  But while
true frogs  members of the Ranidae family  have
smooth  moist skin and long hind legs with webbed
feet  true toads  members of the Bufonidae family 
have dry  bumpy skin and short hind legs  And
unlike their North American frog cousins  North
American toads are poisonous at all stages of their
life cycle: egg  tadpole  and adult 
Toad poison is a fluid produced from large
parotid glands behind the animal's eyes and from
glands on its back  The fluid tastes terrible and will
burn a predator's mouth  eyes  and skin  Depending
on the species  the toad's poison ranges from irritating
to deadly  Some species  such as the fire bellied
toads  Bombina 
of Europe and
Asia  are aposematic 
advertising
their toxins
by arching their
backs and raising
both their front and hind legs to display their
red  or yellow and black bellies 
All toads are hunters  They eat fish  worms 
slugs  spiders  birds  mice  and especially insects 
which makes them welcome to gardeners and
farmers  But one toad has become more of a
nuisance than a friend and humans have only
themselves to blame for the problem  It's the cane
or marine toad  Bufo marinus  



Indigenous to Central and South America 
the cane toad lives mainly on land  but it breeds
in fresh water  It can spray  as well as ooze  its
heart stopping poison  In its native habitats 
the cane toad population has been kept in check
by predators  which include fish  caimans  and
snakes  But in Australia  this amphibian has
become a serious pest 
Up until 1935  Australia had no toads at all 
Some people thought it would be a good idea to
bring in a species that would eat sugar cane pests:
greyback and French's cane beetles  Dermolepida
albohirtum and Lepidiota frenchi   They selected
the cane toad  which had been introduced in
Hawaii and was doing well in that climate 
Unfortunately  the toads failed to eat the beetles 
Instead  they bred and bred and bred some
more and began to eat other critters  including
Australia's native frogs 
But few critters could eat the cane toads and
survive  Fish that ate their tadpoles died  Other
animals  including crocodiles and pet dogs  that
dined on the adult toads died  too  The northern
quoll  Dasyurus hallucatus   a carnivorous marsupial 
has now become severely endangered  not
only because of habitat loss  but also because of
cane toad poisoning  A recent study says that
several snakes are evolving defenses against the
toads  They are developing smaller heads and
longer bodies  which means that they can't swallow
the cane toads they can take only smaller
and safer prey 
Other Australian predators  such as a few
varieties of turtles and snakes  can tolerate the
toad's toxins  Some species of birds and rats  have
adapted to eat only the toad's nontoxic tongue or
have learned to flip the toad  attack its belly  and
devour its internal organs 
Unfortunately  there aren't enough predators
to eat enough of the toads  And the diseases and
parasites that control the toad population in other
countries aren't found in Australia  Then there's
the stunning fact that each pair of toads can produce
as many as thirty five thousand eggs twice
a year  That's a lot of toads and a lot of toad
toxin  Australia is currently spending millions
of dollars to find biological controls to deal with
the species  Environmentalists have even recently
asked the country's military to wage war on them
in an effort to stop their spread 



Some snakes  such as hognose  Heterodon  and water snakes
 Nerodia   are immune to toad poison and can eat adult toads 
Hognose snakes are mildly venomous
to people  Water snakes
are not known to be venomous 
but people sometimes confuse
them with a snake that is 
the cottonmouth  Agkistrodon
piscivorus   also known as the
water moccasin 
The cottonmouth is the only venomous aquatic snake in
America  It is rarely found far from a water source a pond 
a lake  a slow moving stream  a swamp  or an estuary  an area
where freshwater and seawater mix   Although this snake has a
bad reputation  it is not aggressive  When it's threatened  it will
try to escape or it will"gape ” opening its mouth wide to show
the white lining  which is how it got its name  If the enemy does
not back off  it may bite with its long fangs to inject powerful
hemotoxic venom 
However  it mostly uses this venom to kill prey such as
fish  frogs  and mice  and the toxins are rarely strong enough
to be fatal to humans  A cottonmouth will never feast on
toads  That dinner might very well be its last 




Some of those amphibians are toads  Others
are newts and salamanders  Actually  a newt is
a salamander but a salamander isn't always
a newt  Salamanders are found in a variety of
habitats  They may be entirely aquatic  or they
may be terrestrial though  in that case  they still
generally need moisture in which to lay eggs  or
the eggs themselves have to be moist inside for
the larvae to spend their aquatic stage in them 
Some salamanders lay eggs on dry land  but then
the eggs don't hatch until spring rains submerge
them  Newts always breed in water  but they
spend the rest of the year on land  so they're
called semi aquatic 
Like toads and certain
frogs  newts and
salamanders secrete poison
through their scaleless
skin  In addition 
as a defense  some newts have sharp ribs that poke
through their back  The ribs can jab a predator's
mouth and also deliver more of the toxin 
Salamander and newt poison ranges from
mild to lethal  The American rough skinned newt
 Taricha granulosa  is one of the most toxic animals
known to science  It produces tetrodotoxin 



a deadly neurotoxin that blocks signals from
the brain that tell an animal's lungs how to
breathe and its heart how to beat  Although
this poison is the newt's defense against shore
birds  bullfrogs  fish  and other predators  it has
also been known to hurt and even kill people 
In one case  a scientist had a wound on his
finger  He handled a newt  and the toxin entered
the cut  He suffered from nausea  dizziness  and
a totally numb arm for half an hour  In another
far worse incident  a man swallowed a rough skin
newt on a dare  Within ten minutes  his lips
began to tingle  During the next two hours  he
became weak and numb  and then  despite hospital
treatment  his heart stopped and he died 
It's best not to handle this amphibian and  for
goodness sake  don't ever swallow one!
Many newts and salamanders are aposematic 
Some  like young red spotted newts  Notophthalmus
viridescens   which are called red efts  walk boldly
through the eastern American woods  displaying
their brilliant red orange skin to warn predators
of their poison  Others  such as the western red bellied
newt  Taricha rivularis   curve their heads
and legs over their backs to display their scarlet
undersides when they're threatened much as
red bellied toads do 
European fire salamanders  Salamandra salamandra 
not only have poisonous black and yellow
skin  but they also can spray toxins from
glands on their backs  These amphibians can tilt
their bodies in an enemy's direction and spray
farther than six feet 
Some predators can see these warning colors 
but others can't  so newts and salamanders
also wave their heads or tails and make sounds
to warn enemies  One woodland critter that has
learned to recognize these movements and noises
and so avoid noshing on newts is the short tailed
shrew  Blarina brevicauda   the only venomous
mammal in North America and one of the few
venomous mammals in the world 




Shrews are tiny  solitary  mostly nocturnal
animals found in temperate forests throughout
most of the world  Fierce predators  they eat
many kinds of animals  including insects  earthworms 
spiders  birds  amphibians  and rodents
 which are sometimes larger than the shrew
itself   as well as vegetation  nuts  and fruits 
When a shrew bites its prey  toxic saliva flows
through grooves in its lower front teeth to kill or
paralyze the victim  Shrews use a lot of energy  so
they must eat constantly  They store piles of live 
paralyzed prey in their burrows so they'll always
have plenty of fresh food on hand 
Although a shrew is immune to its own
venom  it probably is not immune to the venom
of fellow shrews  These little carnivores are known
for feuding over territory  So if a shrew gets bitten
by another shrew during a turf war  it may become
paralyzed or die 
If you were to get chomped by a shrew 
you'd experience pain and swelling  but you'd be
unlikely to expire  In fact  shrew venom may be
used in the future to help treat migraines  high
blood pressure  and neuromuscular diseases  and
even to smooth out wrinkles 
Shrews are eaten by owls  hawks  weasels 
snakes  and salamanders  but other predators
won't touch them  That's not because of their
venom  It's because of their stink  A shrew's scent
glands make it smell and taste mighty bad  So if
your cat leaves a shrew on your doorstep  Felix
may well be telling you

Like humans  the slow loris  Nycticebus
coucang  is a primate  It has five strong  gripping
fingers with nails on each hand  opposable
thumbs  they can touch the other fingers   three
kinds of teeth  and a well developed brain 
among other characteristics  The slow loris lives
in rainforests and other woodlands  as well as
in suburban gardens  where it spends its days
sleeping in the trees and its nights searching
for fruit  eggs  insects  and other small prey to
eat  It moves slowly and deliberately hand overhand 
though it can climb quickly if startled 
It's such an adorable critter  with its big eyes
and tiny ears who would guess it's toxic?
Dr  Bryan Fry knows it's toxic  After having been
bitten several times by these animals  he's discovered
that slow lorises secrete toxin from tissues
similar to sweat pores on the inside of their
elbows  The animals take the toxin into their
mouths and deliver it with their saliva when
they bite in self defense  Fry says it appears
that mother lorises also comb this toxin through
their babies' fur  possibly as protection from
predators  There's much to be learned about this
mysterious new mammalian poison  and it suggests
that more toxic animals may be out there
than we could ever have imagined 

We're in a New Guinea rainforest 
where agarwood trees grow  birdwing butterflies
glow  and poisonous birds flourish  You don't
believe me? Ask a local resident  and he'll point
out a pretty  red and black creature nicknamed a
“rubbish bird ” Ask a scientist  and he'll tell you
it's a Pitohui dichrous a hooded pitohui  
Whatever the name  one taste and you'd  
go too 
The scientist who first documented the poisonous
bird was Jack Dumbacher  In 1989  he caught
a hooded pitohui  and  as he was removing it
from the net  it bit and scratched his hands  He
put a finger in his mouth  and his lips and tongue
went numb  From talking to the locals  he discovered
that the species was toxic 


The hooded and two other pitohui species  as
well as another bird  the blue capped ifrita  Ifrita
kowaldi   are the only known toxic birds so
far  They have cardio  and neurotoxins called
batrachotoxins in their feathers and skin that make
them smell and taste terrible  Recently  Avit
Wako  a New Guinean naturalist  seems to have
discovered the source of the toxins: tiny Melyrid
beetles  example: Choresine pulchra   which the
birds eat  If tasted  both the birds and the beetles
cause people to have burning  tingling sensations
in their mouths 


Toxic Birds
Once upon a time  brightly colored  native parakeets lived
all over the eastern    They were called Carolina parakeets
 Conuropsis carolinensis   and they traveled in huge  noisy flocks of
sometimes as many as one thousand birds  But by the early twentieth
century  the species went extinct  No one is sure what caused
this sad event  Theories include loss of habitat  over hunting  and
disease  or a combination of all of these  Some experts feel that
disease was the primary factor  and it revolved around the birds'
favorite food  cockleburs 
The cocklebur is a weed that grows in cleared areas around
homes and farms  It is toxic to domestic animals  but the parakeets
were able to eat the plant with no ill effects  People appreciated
the birds' diet because it reduced the weeds and protected their
livestock  Several naturalists described how the toxins protected the
parakeets  too  by killing animals that tried to eat them 
But as settlements spread  so did cockleburs  When the birds
visited the communities to feed on the plants  they were exposed
to more and more diseases that are carried by livestock  Because the
birds weren't immune to these diseases  they died 
America may indeed have had its own species of toxic birds  It
is unfortunate that none of us will ever get to see one


Melyrid beetles are also found across the
globe in Central and South American rainforests 
There  they are the diet of poison dart frogs and
they're the reason some varieties of these little 
jewel colored amphibians  as well as the pitohui
and ifrita  are poisonous  If the frogs are removed
from their habitat and are fed nontoxic insects 
their toxicity lessens  Frogs born and raised in
captivity and fed on nonpoisonous bugs never
become poisonous at all 
In the wild  poison dart frogs are much more
toxic than poisonous birds  In fact  the golden
poison dart frog  Phyllobates terribilis  is one of the
most poisonous animals in the world  This tiny
amphibian has enough batrachotoxin in its skin
to kill twenty thousand mice or at least eight
human beings if they were to eat the toxin or
absorb enough of it through a wound  A lethal
dose of this poison for a 150 pound person is
136 micrograms the equivalent of two or three
grains of salt! But according to medical studies 
poison dart frog toxins may also turn out to be
useful as antibiotics and painkillers  substances
that cure rather than kill 
All poison dart frogs are aposematic  so most
predators know to avoid them  But the Choco
people  South American natives of Columbian
rainforests  have learned to catch the frogs and
collect their venom  They rub it
on the darts they use to hunt birds 
monkeys  and other animals 
which is how the frogs got their
familiar name  The poison kills the
prey  but doesn't hurt the hunters
who eat the meat 


Nope  Would you believe that its daring color
is actually camouflage? This nocturnal  venomous
snake named for the scales above its eyes rests
in trees among flowers  fruit  and leaves  hiding
from predators  A type of pit viper  the eyelash
viper is plentiful in banana groves  where it blends
in perfectly  Throughout its range in Central and
South America  the snake shows a wide variety of
colors  all designed to merge with its surroundings 
Many species of snakes are found in rainforests 
The best known ones are the non venomous
boas and anacondas  Eunectes murinus  
But along with the eyelash viper  there are many
venomous varieties  Some  such as the rear fanged
vine snakes  are arboreal they live up in
the trees and eat lizards  small mammals  and
baby birds  They must wrap around their prey and
chew for several seconds or even minutes to inject
their venom  Most are not dangerous to people


Other snakes  such as the Central and South
American fer de lance and the bushmaster
 Lachesis muta   are terrestrial  living under leaves
or in logs on the ground  Like the eyelash viper
 and the American cottonmouth and the copperhead  
both the fer de lance and the bushmaster
are pit vipers  These nocturnal snakes
have long fangs and potent hemotoxic venom 
The fer de lance feeds on rodents  lizards  and
frogs and is probably responsible for more human
deaths in South America than any other snake 
The bushmaster  which can grow to twelve feet 
making it the longest venomous snake in the
Americas  is one of the few
snakes to eat only mammals 
While the fer de lance can
live around farms and homes 
the bushmaster is found only
in undisturbed rainforests  so
people are much less likely to
encounter it 
The Gaboon viper  Bitis gabonica  of African
forests  coastal dunes  and other areas is the heaviest
of all vipers  and it produces the most venom 
It's also in the record books as the snake with the
longest fangs up to two inches in length  Its
colors camouflage it among the leaf litter  where
it lies waiting to catch large rodents  ground
birds  and other prey  Like some of its relatives 
this viper can inflate its body and then deflate it
with a hissing sound to threaten predators 



Most coral snakes are found in tropical forests 
but the American species  the only terrestrial fixed fang
snakes in the     also live in woodlands and
in dry  desert like areas  They have strong neurotoxic
venom  but they are not aggressive and their
fangs are small  so bites are rare  However  because
they're so pretty  kids sometimes pick them up and
get bitten 
Coral snakes  example: Micrurus fulvius  have
several harmless mimics  such as the scarlet king
snake  Lampropeltis triangulum   The way to tell
them apart inspired this rhyme:"Red touching yellow
kills a fellow/ Red touching black is a friend of
Jack ” It refers to the bands of color on the snakes 
Have a look  Can you tell which is venomous?
This rhyme actually applies mainly to the
North American species  Many of the tropical
coral snakes with red touching black are NOT
friends of Jack  They're venomous  So  whatever
bands of color are touching  don't you touch any
of these snakes!


 Snakes are not the only fanged creatures in rainforests  Spiders
lurk there  too  including some varieties of tarantulas  funnel webs 
and one of the most venomous spiders in the world: the Brazilian
wandering spider   Phoneutria    This dangerous arachnid can inflict
a very painful  neurotoxic bite  It gets its name from the fact that it
travels forest floors to catch prey instead of building a web 
But this spider journeys in more ways than one  It has been
known to hide in fruit and to hitch rides to countries far from
home  In 2005  a chef in Bridgwater  England  was bitten by a
wandering spider that had stowed away in a box of bananas 
Before he passed out  he snapped a photo of the arachnid with
his camera phone and that picture saved his life  Doctors at the
local hospital sent the picture to the Bristol Zoo  where experts
identified the five inch long spider and told them which antivenin
to give the man  It took a week  but the chef did recover 



It has webbed feet and a bill like a duck  lives
by Australian rivers  and lays eggs  But it isn't a
bird  Can you name this critter?
That's right it's a platypus  Ornithorhynchus
anatinus   a semi aquatic mammal  Found in a
wide variety of Australian habitats from snowy
highland woods to steamy rainforests  it swims
the rivers and streams looking for food  Its sensitive
bill has receptors to read electrical currents 
which allow the animal to judge its distance from
prey and to distinguish insect larvae  freshwater
shrimp  and crayfish from nonliving objects  A
platypus can stay underwater for ten minutes or
so without surfacing  When it isn't hunting  it
rests in its burrow in the riverbank 
The platypus  along with three species of echidnas
 Zaglossus  spiny anteaters found in Australia
and New Guinea are monotremes  the only egg laying
mammals on Earth  Echidnas are not venomous 
But the male platypus is  Unlike shrews 
his toxins aren't in his saliva  They're in his thighs 
The venom glands in a male platypus's legs
are connected to hollow spurs on his hind feet 
To inject venom  the platypus kicks its legs and
jabs the spurs  Some scientists think that these
spurs are used both in self defense and in fighting
off other males when the platypuses are looking
for mates  The venom can cause pain and swelling
in people  so it's not a good idea to try to
break up a platypus fight  Let those platypuses
work things out for themselves


Platypuses may be the least familiar creatures
found in rivers  What are the most familiar? Fish 
Rivers are home to many kinds of fish: sharptoothed
carnivores  such as red bellied piranhas
 Pygocentrus nattereri  in the Amazon  vegetarian
grass carp  Ctenopharyngodon idella  in the Amur 
and other more common species  such as catfish 
in the Mississippi 
With their smooth skin and barbels whiskers 
these"cats” may look harmless  But as any
catfish fisherman can tell you  they have weapons
to protect themselves: sharp spines in the fins on
both their back and sides  In some catfish species 
these spines are venomous 
The madtom  Noturus  found in some rivers
in the    can give you a nasty bee like sting 
The smallest species  the tadpole madtom  Noturus
gyrinus  has the most painful sting of all  But  like
most catfish  it will zap you only when trapped or
handled  Its Asian riverine cousin  the Indian catfish
 Heteropneustes fossilis   will attack any enemy
that enters its territory and its sting also hurts 
The brightly striped marine catfish  Plotosus lineatus  
found in oceans and estuaries  is equally toxic 
Catfish and the majority of other animals 
are most venomous when they are fully grown 
However  scats  Scatophagus argus   which are found
in estuaries  harbors  and the lower parts of rivers 
are most venomous when they are babies  The
youngsters can give mild stings with their spines 
Youngsters are easy
prey for many predators 
so being a toxic
baby makes sense 
Eggs are also prey  So
some animals lay eggs
that are poisonous  Just
ask a North American
gar  example: Atractosteus spatula   The adult fish 
however  is not venomous at all  It doesn't need to
be  Its armor like scales and sharp teeth are plenty
of protection against almost any enemy 
Ichthyologists  fish scientists  used to think
there were only about two hundred species of
venomous fish  Now Dr  William Leo Smith and
Ward  Wheeler of the American Museum of
National History believe that there may be more
than a thousand  However  most of them do not
live in freshwater  They're found in oceans and
seas  especially in the Indo Pacific  A few species
have been in American waters for a long time 
but a few others have recently arrived  Let's take
a swim and meet some of them 



Relatives of sharks  rays are flat bodied fish
that have cartilage dense connective tissue 
instead of bones  They swim with a flying motion
of their large  wing like pectoral fins  Not all rays
are stingrays  but all stingrays have stingers 
The stinger is a long  jagged spine  It can
be clipped off  like a fingernail  and it will grow
back  It has two grooves filled with venom producing
tissue  and it is surrounded by a sheath
that may also produce venom  Stingray venom
is neurotoxic  and anyone who is"stung” should
seek medical attention 
Stingrays are common in coastal waters
throughout the world  There are some freshwater
species  such as the mottled stingray  Potamotrygon
hystrix  of the Amazon  but most are
ocean dwellers  including the southern stingray
 Dasyatis americana  of the Caribbean 
Some rays are benthic they spend most of
their time resting in the shallows  feeding on
worms  clams  shrimp  crabs  snails  and occasionally
fish  Benthic rays have spines at the ends
of their long"tails ” Others are pelagic open
water swimmers  The barbs of pelagic rays are
close to their bodies  probably to protect their
organs in case they are bitten as they swim 



Rays are generally peaceful animals  They
will use their spines only if they are stepped on
or otherwise threatened and then they can lash
out forcefully to protect themselves  A large ray
can exert enough power to drive its barb into a
wooden boat  Most injuries occur when a person
steps directly on a ray  so waders are advised to
shuffle not stomp their feet in waters where
benthic stingrays lurk  That will usually make
the rays swim out of the way 
At the Great Barrier Reef  Steve Irwin  the
Australian naturalist nicknamed the"Crocodile
Hunter ” was killed by a bull ray's  Dasyatis
brevicaudata  stinger but not by its venom  The
ray's barb pierced his heart  and he died almost
instantly after pulling it out  A stingray's sting is
painful  but it is rarely fatal  The strange thing
is  according to The Australian News  Irwin was
apparently searching for another creature that is
deadly the reef stonefish 



The reef stonefish  Synanceia verrucosa  is a
benthic fish that lives on reefs  often under rocks
or ledges  in sandy shallows  and in mud flats 
Squat  lumpy  and usually dark colored though
sometimes splashed with pink or red the fish lies
there  looking like a rock or a piece of coral  With
this camouflage  it can fool prey  When small fishes
and shrimp unknowingly swim by  the stonefish
opens its mouth and  in a flash  swallows them 
Enemies may be fooled  too  But if they get too
close  the stonefish erects its toxic defense: thirteen
venomous spines along its back  These spines can
pierce right through the bottom of sneakers and
flippers  Each spine has enough venom to kill
one thousand mice and it can be fatal to people 
Pressing on the spines releases the toxins  which
cause excruciating pain  swelling  tissue destruction 
muscle weakness  paralysis  shock  and sometimes
death by heart failure  There is now an antivenin
to treat these severe stings 



The stonefish has few natural enemies  The
rumor that sea snakes  which live in the same
oceans  eat these creatures is not true  Some sea
snakes specialize in certain prey  such as fish eggs
or eels  others eat a wide variety of fish  Most
species are venomous 
Descendants of Australian land snakes  sea
snakes are well adapted for marine life  They have
flattened tails to help them swim  They can seal
their mouths and nostrils to keep out water  Like
all snakes  they have lungs  but sea snakes can also
absorb oxygen directly from seawater through
their skin  This is called cutaneous respiration 
and it enables a sea snake to stay underwater for
several hours before having to surface and breathe 
Many of these species can be found in shallow
water  but the highly venomous yellow bellied
sea snake  Pelamis platurus  is pelagic 
Another myth about sea snakes is that they
have tiny fangs and can only penetrate the thin 
tender skin between our fingers  The truth is that
even though sea snakes have fixed fangs  these
teeth are not especially tiny  and they can puncture
human skin in many places on our bodies 
However  sea snakes are
not usually inclined to
bite people and when
they do bite  they often
do not deliver venom 
That's a good thing
because their neuro and
myotoxic  affecting
skeletal muscles  venom
is quite potent 
An antivenin is available  and it can be used
against all sea snake envenomations  as well as
that of sea kraits  Laticauda   which are also
marine snakes  It's made from the venom of the
beaked sea snake  Enhydrina schistosa   which is
responsible for more than half of sea snake bites
and ninety percent of fatalities caused by sea
snakes  It isn't particularly aggressive  but it lives
in shallow estuaries and more frequently comes
into contact with people who fish and wade in
these places  particularly in Southeast Asia 
It is unusual for a single species' antivenin to
be effective against the bites of other species  The
beaked sea snake's venom is a simple one  unlike
the complex mixtures of toxins that make up land
snakes' venoms  Dr  Bryan Fry believes that the
simplicity of the venom comes from the simplicity
of sea snakes' lives and diet: They eat fish and
other small marine creatures  while land snakes
eat a much wider variety of animals and live in
more diverse habitats 


Believe it or not  it goes by every name
except The gorgeous lionfish  Pterois   as it
is most commonly called  is the cousin of the
unattractive stonefish  Both are members of the
venomous scorpionfish family  Like its camouflaged
relatives  the aposematic maroon striped
lionfish has venomous spines in its fins  which it
uses in self defense  When it feels threatened  the
fish opens its mouth wide and flares these fins 
Males may also possibly use their spines to battle
other males during mating season 
The lionfish is native to the Indo Pacific area 
where it is found swimming around reefs  often
in shallow areas  and sometimes in bays  estuaries 
and harbors  So  unless you take a trip to that area 
you're not likely to encounter a lionfish  right?
Not necessarily      
Lionfish are now found in the Atlantic Ocean
from Florida to New York and they are thriving 
although mainly at depths of one hundred twenty
feet or more  where the Gulf Stream warms the
waters  How did they get there? The answer lies
in the lionfish's looks  With their flashy stripes 
lionfish have become popular aquarium fish in the
   In 1992  when Hurricane Andrew destroyed
a Florida aquarium  six lionfish were accidentally
released into Biscayne Bay  At other times  captive
lionfish were probably set free on purpose by
home aquarium owners who didn't want to deal
with toxic critters that grow large and eat the other
fish in the tank  This practice of releasing animals
in non native areas is not only bad for the environment 
but it's also against the law 
As lionfish thrive in the Atlantic  more people 
such as divers and fishermen  are likely to
encounter them and therefore  to get stung  A
lionfish's stab is usually not fatal  but it will cause
severe pain and swelling  sometimes for days or
weeks even if the fish was not alive when the
victim was stung  Dr  William Leo Smith found
that out when he was a college student working
in a pet shop that sold these fish  As he reached
into a garbage pail into which a telephone had
fallen  Smith got zapped by a dead lionfish that
someone had thrown away 
Other venomous fish are also dangerous
when deceased because the venom remains in the
spines and is released by pressure  And sometimes
the spines break and remain in a person's
skin  causing infection  All in all  a goldfish or a
guppy makes a much safer pet than a member of
the scorpionfish clan 



Toadfish  Batrachoididae 
There are forty five species of toadfish  but not all are toxic 
The venomous varieties are found in coastal Central and South
America  Their toxins cause pain  swelling  dizziness  and fever 
as well as wounds that take a long time to heal  One species  the
niquim  Thalassophryne nattereri   is responsible for injuring many
Brazilian fishermen yearly when they step on it or accidentally get
jabbed by its spines as they try to remove it from a fishing net 
Why is it called a"toadfish”? Well  with its squat body and
big mouth  it looks somewhat like a toad and when it croaks or grunts  it sounds a bit like one  too 
Stargazer  Uranoscopus 
Found in coastal areas all around the world  this fish gets
its name from you guessed it its eyes  which sit on top of its
head  looking upward  Some species have a worm shaped lure in
their mouths  They wiggle it to attract their prey's attention  and
then leap up to grab the victim  In addition to having venomous
spines behind its gills  the stargazer can also deliver an electric
shock to any enemy that dares to seize it 
Weever  Trachinus 
Weevers are found in the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean  When this fish lies buried in
the sand  only the top of its head and the tips of its spines are visible  Its neurotoxic venom is painful 
though not usually fatal  The treatment for its toxins  and
that of many of the other venomous fishes  is soaking the
affected limb in very hot water for thirty to ninety minutes
and then repeating as often as necessary  The heat breaks
down the protein in the venom 



Some do  Striped bass  king mackerel  whiting  and many other
species love bloodworms  Glycera dibranchiata  
Bloodworms live in sandy  silty  or muddy shores  They are polychaetes 
segmented marine worms with bristles called setae  Each
worm can be more than a foot long  with a three inch proboscis that
is eversible it can be turned inside out  The proboscis is tipped with
four hard  venomous fangs for hunting and self defense 
Most animals' teeth contain the mineral calcium  Scientists have
recently discovered that bloodworm fangs are made of a combination
of protein and copper  The bloodworm is the only species known to
make its own copper teeth! Its bite can hurt for days  so wormers looking
for bait have to be careful digging for and handling these critters 
Most nemertines  or ribbon worms  example: Amphiporus bimaculatus  
are benthic animals that live in shallow seas or coastal waters 
They get their name from their great length  They are among the longest
creatures in the sea  They're also called proboscis worms because
they have an eversible proboscis they use to capture prey 
In some species the proboscis is equipped with a single thin stylet
that injects neurotoxic venom  The stylet is usually released by
the worm  or it breaks off upon striking the prey  When the worm
withdraws its proboscis  it loads another stylet  A ribbon worm may
have six stylets in reserve at any one time  Harmless to people  these
worms hunt for small invertebrates  animals without backbones  
such as other worms 
Another group of polychaetes  the fireworms  also called bristleworms  
live on reefs  beneath stones  and in sea grass or mud
 example: Hermodice carunculata   On their sides they have venomous
setae that penetrate fish  then break off  releasing irritating
venom  The venom doesn't kill the fish  but it may teach them to
leave these worms alone  Any person pierced by a fireworm's setae
will probably learn the same thing 


Sharks and big teeth go
together  But sharks and
venom? Yep  Just ask a spiny
dogfish  Squalus acanthias  
A small shark that hunts
in packs like canines  the
spiny dogfish is something
a fisherman doesn't care to
snare  If this critter is caught
in a fishing line  it will curl
into a bow and strike with its two sharp spines 
Each spine has a groove with a gland inside to
make and pump venom  The bad news is that any
fisherman pierced by these spines will be in pain
for hours or even days  The good news is that he
or she will survive 
There are several other venomous sharks 
Some  like the spiny dogfish  can live in shallow
or deep water to depths of
six hundred feet  A relative of
the shark called the chimaera
 example: Chimaera monstrosa 
is almost never found above six
hundred feet 
In Greek mythology  the
chimaera is a monster with a
lion's head  a goat's body  and a
serpent's tail  The fishes of that
name look monstrous and rather stitched together 
too  Big headed and big eyed with a long  rat like
tail  the chimaera feeds on small animals that live
near the bottom of the ocean  Unlike a shark  it
has four large plates in its mouth instead of teeth 
Because it dwells so deep in the water  few people
have ever seen one and fewer have probably been
stabbed by its single spine 


Some people have reported that chimaeras and many
sharks are toxic to eat  However  the most dangerous food
fish isn't a shark or a chimaera  It's the puffer  or blowfish  
This fish gets its name from its ability to inflate itself so that
it is too large for an enemy to swallow  Some species are
prickly  as well  Not every species of puffer is poisonous  but
many are  If a predator does manage to eat a toxic puffer  it
will probably die because the fish's skin  blood  and organs
contain tetrodotoxin  and each fish has enough of the stuff
to kill thirty people or a dozen elephants   Though the
elephants are far less likely than humans to eat it! 



And humans do eat it the tasty flesh and fins
of one species  that is  In Japan  people order a
variety of this expensive fish  known as fugu  Fugu
rubides  in restaurants  Only special licensed chefs
are allowed to prepare it  They have to remove
the poisonous bits  and they must be very skilled
because just a tiny amount of the fish's tetrodotoxin 
enough to fit on a pinhead can kill a
person 
But the toxin may soon have a healing use 
too  Scientists are now testing a drug made
from it as a non addictive painkiller for patients
with cancer and other illnesses  In clinical trials 
patients were treated with tiny amounts of the
drug twice a day for four days  After three days 
nearly seventy percent of them felt less pain 
The relief often lasted way beyond the last
injection in some cases more than two weeks 
Each fish can provide six hundred doses of the
drug  so there is currently an ample supply  It
will take more trials  but puffer poison may soon
be a great new medicine on the market 


They're cute  they're brilliantly colored  and
they're toxic  Meet the fanged blennies  the only
fish known to have venomous bites! The poison 
used only in self defense  flows up two fangs in
the fish's lower jaw  The blenny can regulate its
flow  Is this venom dangerous to humans? Not
really  The blenny's bite has been compared to a
wasp sting nasty  but not deadly 
Some blennies have harmless imitators  The
golden mimic blenny  Plagiotremus laudanus flavus 
is a non venomous fish that looks just like
a canary fang blenny  Meiacanthus oualanensis  
Predators avoid it  too 
Where are these unique fish found? Like some
lionfish and stonefish  they live in
the"rainforests of the oceans” 
the coral reefs  And that's where
we're headed next



Many types of corals live in the world's oceans 
All are cnidarians  ny   Cnidarians
are among the oldest groups of animals  They
have tentacles feelers covered with stinging
darts called nematocysts  When an animal brushes
against these nematocysts  they fire venom into its
skin  Cnidarians use their venom to kill fish for
food and to protect themselves 
Not all corals are reef builders  Only some
species of hard corals  example: Turbinaria 
have that ability  These corals form colonies
that join together to construct organisms such
as the Great Barrier Reef  A reef may look like
bare rock  but it's made up of living animals and
skeletons  Each hard coral on the reef creates a
stony  calcium carbonate outer case and hides
inside it all day  Living corals build their cases
on tops of the cases of dead ones  At night  the
corals come out to feed  waving their tentacles
and firing their nematocysts at tiny sea creatures
that sweep by 
Most corals can't hurt people  But in Florida's
waters and in the Caribbean  a relative of true
corals called fire coral  Millepora  will make your
skin burn if you touch it 



Reefs are rather like apartment houses  and a lot of
their tenants are venomous  Venom is a powerful weapon
for protection and hunting when there's so much competition
for food and space  Many types of sea anemones
live on reefs  These strange relatives of coral look like
flowers  but they are animals and they can sting 
Sea anemones can creep or float  but most of the time 
they don't move  They are found in oceans all around the
world  in both deep and shallow water  clinging to rocks 
shells  coral  sand  and shipwrecks 
Each sea anemone is a cnidarian with a thick body
topped by a mouth surrounded by a ring of fleshy  nematocyst 
covered tentacles  Most species have nematocysts
that are too weak to penetrate human skin  but some  such
as the branching anemone  Lebrunia danae  and the fire
anemone  Actinodendron plumosum   can sting people  and
their venom
causes itching 
burning 
swelling  and
severe pain 
The hydra  Hydra  is a
small  freshwater relative
of the sea anemone 
another cnidarian with
stinging tentacles  It eats
tiny critters such as water
fleas and insect larvae
and is no danger to large
animals 
In Greek mythology 
the Hydra was a many headed
monster  If you
cut off one head  two
would grow in its place 
Though our little hydra
friend can reproduce
through the mating of a male and female  it can also do
so by budding  with no male required  just as corals can 
Budded baby hydras just grow right out of their mother's
“sides ” A hydra can have as many as four buds  which turn
into offspring and no beheading is required!
Coral


A few animals eat sea anemones  Many others
avoid them  But not the anemonefishes  such as
this clownfish  Amphiprion ocellaris  made famous
in the animated film Finding Nemo 
Clownfishes and their relatives live in the
anemones  feeding on algae and plankton  These
fish have a thick coating of mucus that makes
them immune to the anemones' stings  Some
anemonefish have a specific type of anemone
as their partner  Others visit several varieties of
anemones  The fish are protected by the cnidarians 
and  though no one is sure what the
anemones get in return  it is possible that the fish
protect them by chasing away predators 
There are two current theories about how and
where the anemonefish gets its mucus covering 
One is"acclimatization” the fish swims for
hours among the anemone's tentacles  making
brief contact  receiving non lethal stings  and
smearing the mucus from the cnidarian onto its
own body  A second theory states that the mucus
comes from the fish  and it lacks an element that
causes the anemone to fire its nematocysts 
Both theories may be true  For anemonefish
that visit several species of anemones  the acclimatization
theory makes sense  For anemonefish
that have just one host  the mucus theory may be
more relevant 


Another critter that doesn't fear sea anemones is
the hermit crab  Unlike other crabs  hermits don't
have their own shell like coverings  They slip into
the abandoned shells of mollusks soft bodied 
shell making animals such as snails and whelks 
Several types of hermit crabs
gather sea anemones and stick
them to their shells for protection 
The anemones may benefit
by getting leftover scraps
of the crabs' food  A single
crab may wear as many as six
anemones on its shell 
Another species  the boxer crab  Lybia tessellata 
of Australia  holds anemones in each of its
claws and  like boxing gloves  thrusts them at
enemies  It may also use the anemones to stun
prey 



They're round  They're colorful  They're the
pincushions of the sea  They're the sea urchins 
and you'll find them feeding mostly on algae on
reefs  in tide pools  sandy shallows  and rocky
rubble  as well as in deep water on sea beds 
Sea urchins are echinoderms animals known
for radial symmetry  arms or rays arranged in a
pattern around a central body  and tube feet that
move through a pumping action  Most  but not
all  echinoderms have spiny skins  Sea urchins'
spines  used for protection  can be short or long 
depending on the species  They can break off
in your skin and cause infection  Some urchins 
such as the fire urchin  Asthenosoma varium  have
venomous spines  which cause more serious pain
and swelling  and sometimes numbness  irregular
heartbeat  and other symptoms 
Besides their spines  urchins  as well as sea stars 
have pedicellariae tiny pincers on stalks used for
self defense and cleaning  In the flower sea urchin
 Toxopneustes pileolus   these pedicellariae make the
creature appear to be a big blossom  But anyone
who touches these"petals” is in for a nasty surprise 
Within them are venomous jaws that deliver a
painful bite  as well as possible paralysis and respiratory
distress  These pincers can hang on and keep
pumping venom even if they're pulled out of the
urchin's body  so they have to be removed from
a victim as quickly as possible  Heat helps break
down the venom  On the Seychelles Islands in
the Indian Ocean  people bitten by these urchins
sometimes put hot oil or drip candle wax onto the
punctures to stop the pain 



Sea stars are the urchins' cousins  There are
eighteen hundred species of this echinoderm 
but only one is known to be venomous: the
Australian crown of thorns starfish  Acanthaster
planci   Its spines  used for self defense  can cause
painful wounds and even paralyze a person 
But the crown of thorns
is more deadly to coral and
for that it doesn't use its
spines  It uses its stomach 
which it pushes out through
its mouth  Strong acids dissolve the coral polyps 
and small hairs collect the gooey food and carry
it inside the sea star  Adult crown of thorns
sea stars eat only coral  and large numbers of
them can destroy entire reefs  Population explosions
of these echinoderms regularly occur  and
experts have many theories as to what causes the
outbreaks  from natural occurrences to human
impact  The good thing is that through studying
this animal  people are learning a lot about the
ecosystem of the reefs 


The reefs are home to many other echinoderms 
Spineless sea cucumbers  example: Holothuria leucospilota  
with their long bodies and tough skin 
look like       cucumbers  Also found in other habitats
such as bedrock  sand  and eelgrass beds  and
in waters both shallow and deep  sea cucumbers
can expel their organs if they're startled by predators 
and then regrow them  Some
sea cucumbers will first produce
sticky threads in self defense  These
contain a neurotoxin called holothurin 
which is deadly to fish and
small mammals 
Believe it or not  sea cucumbers 
including their spewed intestines are eaten in
many Asian countries and elsewhere  They have
to be carefully cleaned  a process that takes days 
They are also prized for medicinal properties  The
flesh and mucus may lower blood pressure  reduce
inflammation  heal wounds  and even slow aging 
Because of the high demand for these delicacies 
sea cucumbers are being over harvested and even
illegally harvested in some parts of the world 
Numerous organizations are currently trying to
address this serious problem


Many types of sponges  Porifera  also live on
the reefs  Poriferans don't have mouths  Instead 
they have tiny pores to draw in water  Cells in
their body walls filter plankton and other food
from the water as it's pumped in and then out of
the sponge's body through larger openings 
Sponges come in all shapes and sizes  Some
look like big holey cheeses or fingers or chimneys 
while others resemble vases  bushes  or flat sheets 
None are venomous they can't bite or sting but
a few  such as the fire and touch me not sponges
 Tedania ignis and Neofibularia nolitangere  are
poisonous if handled  They have toxins that can
cause rashes and swelling 
Fire sponges have red or orange warning colors
to announce that they're toxic  But the most venomous
sea creature in the
world can switch from
warning coloration to
camouflage and back
again with ease  And
it has four times as
many arms as you do!


Found on reefs and in tide pools  caves  holes 
and submerged old bottles and cans  the blue ringed
octopus  Hapalochlaena  of coastal Australia
starts life the size of a pea and grows to the size
of a golf ball  When it is hunting or hiding  its
camouflage colors are light yellow to dark brown 
but when it is threatened  its aposematic colors are
bright yellow with electric blue rings  If this creature
bites you with its parrot like beak  those colors
may be the last ones you'll ever see 
All octopuses probably use toxic saliva to kill
prey such as crabs  but none of them are deadly to
people except for the blue ringed species  It is not
an aggressive animal at all  but it will bite enemies
that provoke it  Because the mollusk  its shell
is inside instead of outside  is so little and cute 
people sometimes pick it up and that's how they
get bitten  Its beak can pierce a diver's wetsuit 
The bite is painless  but the octopus delivers saliva
that contains highly dangerous tetradotoxin 
Within minutes  the victim is paralyzed 
Soon  he or she can no longer breathe  There is
no antivenin  The only way to save the victim is
by giving mouth to mouth resuscitation  rescue
breathing  and heart massage for hours until the
person begins to breathe again on his or her own 
If the victim lives through the first twenty four
hours after being bitten  he or she usually will
recover completely 


People have long appreciated the beauty
of mollusks  Some collect their shells  That's
a fine hobby  as long as the animals aren't
endangered species and as long as the collector
doesn't get zapped by a live and deadly
cone shell  also called cone snail  
Many mollusks have a long tongue called
a radula that is covered with small  hard teeth
used for drilling into or rasping away at food  But
the venomous cone shells' teeth are different 
they can inject conotoxin  which paralyzes and
kills prey  Each tooth is a harpoon that sends out
a fine thread to hook a fish  worm  or another
mollusk  Then the cone shell pulls in its catch 
This allows the slow moving mollusk to capture
faster prey  Sometimes the catch is human 
Like other venomous animals  cone shells
aren't interested in humans as food  However  in
self defense a shell will harpoon folks who pick
it up  Those folks are often collectors drawn to
the shell's beautiful colors and its elegant shape 
Like the blue ringed octopus's beak  the cone
shell's harpoon can pierce
a wetsuit or gloves  and 
depending on the species 
its nearly painless sting
can be fatal  There is no


antivenin  and victims may require mouth to mouth
resuscitation and heart massage  There have been about
thirty reported cone shell deaths since 1935 and perhaps
others that were unrecorded 
Among the most dangerous species found on reefs 
sand  and rubble in the warm  shallow waters of the Indo 
Pacific are the striated cone  Conus striatus   the tulip
cone  Conus tulipa   the textile cone  Conus textile   and
the geographic cone  Conus geographus   These mollusks
produce different toxins at different times  probably to
suit different prey  A cone shell might never use the exact
same combination of toxins twice! Scientists are studying
these toxins for medical uses  especially as non addictive
painkillers  One is already on the market 
Besides their potential for medical use  cone shells also
provide food for people in places such as the Philippines
and Samoa  The venom isn't toxic when eaten  How do
hunters gather these shells? VERY CAREFULLY!
Cone shells' colors are good camouflage against rocks 
coral  and sand  They blend in well  making them hard
for their victims to spot  Another group of venomous sea
creatures is also hard to see because they're see through 
But you can see them on the next page 

Most of these blobs cannot kill people  however 
a few are lethal  We call them all jellyfish 
but they aren't fish at all  They're cnidarians 
Remember that these animals can be polyps or
medusas  Well  most jellyfish are both 
They start life as small larvae called planula 
Then they attach themselves to a surface and
become polyps  These divide and bud into ephyra 
free swimming youngsters that change into
little medusas  The medusas grow into the full sized
adults we see in oceans and aquariums 
Found at all ocean depths  and some even in
freshwater   jellyfish are about ninety five percent
water  They have no backbones  brains  noses  or
ears  but they can detect light and odors through
their nervous system  They swim by pumping
their umbrella like bells  also called floats  This
pumping action lets jellyfish move vertically  But
to move any great distance horizontally  they must
rely on ocean currents  tides  and winds 


Underneath their bells are leaf like"arms”
to bring food to their mouths and thread like
tentacles covered with nematocysts  which fire
neurotoxic venom into prey or predators that
brush against them  A single tentacle can have
hundreds or thousands of nematocysts that fire in
micro seconds even if the tentacle breaks off or
the jellyfish is dead  So when folks tell you not to
touch a jellyfish on the sand  they're not kidding!



The Portuguese man of war  Physalia physalis  
also called a"bluebottle ” is not a jellyfish 
Related to the tiny hydra  it is actually a group
of different types of polyps attached together
beneath an air filled float  It is carried along on
the water's surface by the waves and ocean currents 
The Portuguese man of war's tentacles can
extend sixty five feet below its purple blue float 
They can inflict stings that feel like electrical
shocks and
cause joint and
muscle pain 
faintness  nausea 
chills  and
fever  but they
are usually not
lethal 

Most fish avoid jellyfish  But some  such as
the whiting  Merlangius merlangus  and the man of 
war fish  Nomeus gronovii  do just the opposite 
The whiting's host is the enormous lion's mane
jellyfish  which can be as wide as eight feet with
tentacles up to one hundred twenty feet long 
When a whiting is
threatened  it hides
under the jellyfish for
protection  The man of 
war fish lives with
the Portuguese man of 
war  feeding on its
tentacles  which then
regrow  How does the
fish do this? It appears
to be immune to jellyfish
venom  It may
have a special coating on its body that keeps the
nematocysts from stinging 
Other animals  such as the leatherback turtle
 Dermochelys coriacea   can also eat jellyfish tentacles
without getting poisoned  Unfortunately  turtles
are harmed by eating plastic bags that they mistake
for jellyfish one good reason for people to
recycle these items  to prevent illegal dumping of
garbage in the ocean  and to come up with better
ways of managing waste disposal 
Some nudibranches or sea slugs  Glaucus
atlanticus and Glaucilla marginata  can feast on
the Portuguese man of war without triggering
the nematocysts to fire  The darts get stored
inside the nudibranch's body  so when a fish tries
to eat the sea slug  the fish gets stung 



People and other animals don't have a whiting's
or a nudibranch's protection  A jellyfish or
Portuguese man of war's nematocysts can sting
us through thin clothes or rubber gloves  Most
stings can cause blisters  a rash  and pain  The
lion's mane has a sting that can kill  It is featured
as the innocent murderer in a famous Sherlock
Holmes story "The Adventure of the Lion's
Mane”  This jellyfish's size and the strength of its
venom are what make it dangerous 
The sea nettle  Chrysaora  is another large
jellyfish that packs a nasty  though not usually
deadly  sting  Some species  such as the black
sea nettle  Chrysaora achlyos   can be more than
three feet wide with twenty five foot long tentacles 
In 1989  huge numbers of black sea nettles
appeared off the coast of San Diego  California 
They mysteriously vanished  Then  ten years later 
they bloomed reappeared in record numbers 
Scientists think the reappearance may be due
to more food for these cnidarians caused by
increased nutrients from agricultural run off and
other human activity 
But size doesn't always matter  The box jellyfish
family  which includes the sea wasps and
the Irukandji jellyfish of the Indo Pacific  are
smaller than the lion's mane  but they are the most
deadly cnidarians of all  Unlike other jellyfish  the
peanut sized Irukandji with four three foot long
tentacles  produces a sting that feels mild at first 
But after about thirty minutes or so  it causes
a severe reaction called"Irukandji syndrome ”
a condition of severe muscle spasms  a burning
sensation  and back and kidney pain that can last
for hours or days 


Sea wasps can reach the size of a basketball
with tentacles more than ten feet long  Their
venom can be fatal to people in as few as three
minutes  causing heart or respiratory failure  In
fact  one species  Chironex fleckeri  has been called
the most venomous marine animal in the world 
It has caused many injuries and more than sixty
recorded deaths  So far  there is no antivenin 
In Australia  swimmers once commonly used
pantyhose to avoid being stung by these dangerous
critters  A sea wasp's nematocysts are short 
They can't pierce two layers of nylon  Now special
stinger suits made of Lycra® are available 
But they don't protect a swimmer or diver's face 
hands  or feet  Recently  a team of marine biologists
developed a sunscreen with a repellent that
fools the jellyfish into thinking the person is neither
predator nor prey  They tested it on themselves
and didn't get stung once  It could certainly be a
promising product for folks who like to swim in
dangerous waters 
Jelly with Toast
 or Maybe Rice 
Jellyfish are food not only for fish  turtles  and other marine
creatures  but also for people  Marinated jellyfish is a popular
appetizer in Chinese and other Asian cuisines  What
does this rubbery dish taste like? Not like fish or chicken or
anything meaty  More like a pickled vegetable  How does
this author know? She's eaten it!
Don't panic! Thrashing around will only make it fire
more nematocysts  If you're in the water  call for a lifeguard 
Get medical help as soon as you can  Ask someone
to help you carefully scrape off any clinging tentacles by
first applying shaving cream or a paste of baking soda or
mud and then shaving the area with a razor  a credit card 
a key  or something else with an edge 
As far as home remedies go  here are the ones that
work: white vinegar  meat tenderizer  baking soda  or salt
water applied to your skin  Ones that don't work include:
ice  fresh water  ammonia  alcohol  or urine  Those liquids
will cause more nematocysts to fire  and the last one might
embarrass you  too  


One summer day in 2006  I went to the
American Museum of Natural History's exhibit 
“Lizards and Snakes: Alive!” I got to see a black
mamba  a Gaboon viper  a red spitting cobra  a
Gila monster  and other reptiles up close  The
exhibit was entertaining and educational and
so were the people attending it  Some were fascinated 
Others had the creeps  Still others were
fascinated and had the creeps 
Whenever we encounter animals that can hurt
us  we have strong reactions  And we should  It
makes sense to be both curious about and wary
of dangerous creatures  whether they are reptiles 
amphibians  insects  spiders  mammals  fish 
birds  cnidarians  or something else 
But it also makes sense to protect these
creatures  Why? For one thing  because they do
so much good  Some pollinate plants so that we
can have fruits  flowers  vegetables and other
crops  Others eat pests that destroy these crops
or vermin that spread diseases  Some venomous
animals themselves are edible  From others  we
get medicines  And think of how many have
inspired poems  stories  paintings  films  and
other works of art!
But venomous and poisonous animals also
deserve our respect simply because they're alive 
and they deserve to stay that way 
Unfortunately  many of these animals are in
danger  They are losing their habitats or are being
sickened by pollutants and waste  They are being
sold as pets or killed by pets  They are slaughtered
by people for their skins  for souvenirs  or
simply for no better reason than because folks just
don't like them 
Unless we learn to appreciate these creatures 
we won't safeguard them and their environments 
If we don't safeguard them  we will never uncover
or understand all the marvels of venom and other
biotoxins  We will lose the grace of a jellyfish  the
trill of a toad  the beauty of a butterfly  the surprise
of a snake  and even the awesome scariness
of a big  hairy spider with its venomous fangs 
and that would be a big loss indeed




All over the world there are animals that can hurt or
kill you with a bite  a stab  a sting  or a spit and others
that can hurt or kill if you bite them  These creatures can
be found in many habitats  They ride the waves  They
hide in the sand  They coil around branches  They buzz
around the garden  They even sleep in your closet  And
every one of them is toxic 
Some animals are poisonous  They can make you sick
if you eat them or if you absorb their toxins through
your skin  They use their poison purely as self defense
against predators  and that includes people  Sometimes a
poisonous critter tastes bad enough to make a predator
spit it right out  If your dog or you were to bite
a toxic toad  yuck! But sample some puffer fish  and
chances are you wouldn't even know you could be consuming
a poison that might kill you 
The most famed toxic critters are venomous  This
means they must inject their poison their venom into a
victim by means of fangs  teeth  spines  stingers  or spurs 
These creatures include snakes  spiders  jellyfish  bees 
wasps  scorpions  and a bunch of less familiar animals  But
believe it or not  if they can avoid it  none of these creatures
wants to waste their venom on inedible YOU!

One reason animals use venom is to catch
prey insects  rodents  fish  small mammals 
and even others of their own kind  People
are too big to be food for venomous animals 
However  if by accident or on purpose we
harm these creatures  they will strike back to
protect themselves  Self defense is a second
major reason animals use venom  A third reason
is defense of their family or community 
How dangerous a poisonous or venomous
animal is to humans depends on how strong
its toxins are  how much of them get into you 
and how your body reacts to them

So what exactly are these toxins? Biotoxins
are substances that are created by living cells or
organisms to harm or kill prey or enemies  They
are mostly made up of proteins  Proteins carry out
important functions in animals' bodies  They form
hair  muscles  hemoglobin  part of red blood cells  
and enzymes  large molecules that speed up chemical
reactions   They can make hormones  substances
that give instructions to various body parts  They
can produce antibodies to fight infection 
But proteins can also be destroyers  The
proteins in various toxins often in the form of
enzymes attack cells and tissues  disrupt communication
between nerve endings  and cause
other damage 
Different poisonous or venomous animals
produce specific types of toxins or a combination
of several kinds  Neurotoxins affect the nervous
system and brain  making the victim unable to
move and breathe  Hemotoxins target and destroy
red blood cells  Necrotoxins destroy all types of
tissues  There are other toxins  as well  that specifically
affect the heart  the muscles  the kidneys 
and other vital organs 
Most venom circulates through the lymphatic
system  Lymph is a fluid that protects the body
from germs  It moves slowly  but thoroughly  and
it eventually flows into the bloodstream  Besides
little blood vessels called capillaries  there are lymph
channels in our skin  and many toxins enter those
channels first  although some kinds of venom can
go right into the bloodstream  Snake venom  for
example  is usually circulated by the lymphatic system 
but it can sometimes enter the bloodstream
directly it depends on the size of the molecules
of the toxins  the length of the snake's fangs  where
on the victim the fangs strike  and other factors 
Some venoms can cause
serious injury or even death
by triggering a systemic  whole
body  reaction  Other venoms
cause a localized reaction  For
example  bee and wasp venoms
usually raise a painful lump at the location of
the sting unless the victim is allergic to these toxins 
Then he or she may have a systemic reaction 

When people get stung or bitten by venomous
animals  it is called an envenomation  Doctors
will sometimes treat the victim with antivenins to
fight the toxins  To make an antivenin  scientists
extract venom from the animal  often by getting
it to bite cloth stretched across a bottle or tube 
Then the venom is purified  dried  and frozen  A
weak solution of it is injected into a donor mammal 
which is most often a horse or a sheep  The
mammal doesn't die  It produces antibodies cells
to fight the poison  Blood is drawn from the
donor  and the antibodies are extracted and then
processed into the antivenin 
Each venom requires a different anti venin 
For some dangerous venoms  there are no known
antivenins  Fortunately  most venom is not deadly 
at least  not to humans  Other creatures that
meet up with venomous animals are not so lucky 
As for the venomous critters themselves  most are
immune to their own toxins they can't be hurt
by them 
Now let's travel the globe to meet some of
these killer critters and find out how they use
toxins and why  Where shall we start? How about
your own house

 Some people are allergic to horses and can have a bad reaction
to antivenin made from their antibodies  In addition  antivenin
is expensive to produce and requires drawing a lot of mammal
blood  which causes discomfort to the donors  So scientists are
working on other ways to produce antivenins 
In India  where snakes bite about three hundred thousand
people every year and ten percent of the victims die  biochemists
are working on a unique method of making antivenin  They give
young hens small doses of snake venom and  as they grow older 
the chickens develop special proteins in their blood that act as
antidotes against the toxins  These proteins are passed on to their
eggs and build up in the yolks  The eggs are then collected  and
the proteins are extracted to make the antivenin 
This method could turn out to be safer and a lot less expensive
than extracting antivenin from horses  Fifty eggs produce
the same amount of antivenin as two pints of horse blood  Since
a single hen can lay more than two hundred forty eggs each
year and there are many more hens available than horses that
would produce a lot of antivenin  And that would be good news
for people  and for horses  too  

Spiders are not insects  They are arachnids 
Insects have six legs  and their bodies have three
sections  head  thorax  and abdomen   Arachnids
have eight legs  mouth parts  and their bodies consist
of two parts  the cephalothorax and the abdomen 
There are close to forty thousand species of spiders 
as compared to about a million species of insects 
Most spiders are meat eaters  and almost all
are venomous  They produce venom in special
glands and inject it through the fangs at the tips
of their chelicerae their mouth parts  The shape
of their fangs  straight or curved  differs among
species  Their venom paralyzes or kills prey  The
idea that it also helps turn the prey into liquid food
is probably untrue  Spiders do liquefy prey  but
they use digestive juices from their gut that they
throw up  several times if necessary  onto the prey 
Once the victim is liquefied  the spider can then
suck it up through its specialized mouth  which is
a slit and has hairs that act as a filter 
Smaller spiders eat insects and other spiders 
If the prey is small enough  they may not even
bother with venom  They will just crush or chew
it with their chelicerae and liquefy it with their
digestive juices  Larger spiders eat insects and
other spiders  too  but they may also feed on
mice  birds  frogs  lizards  and snakes sometimes
even poisonous ones 

Different types of spiders hunt in different
ways  Some spin sticky silken webs to catch prey
or make"trigger” lines over burrows that alert
the spider to prey walking over them  Some cast
silken nets  Others don't use silk for hunting at
all they stalk prey on the ground 
Many spiders use silk to wrap up their victims 
This prevents the prey from struggling and
hurting the spider  It also means the prey can be
stored and eaten later  Some spiders bite first 
then wrap their prey  others wrap first  then bite 
And they're just waiting to bite you  right?
Nope  Few spiders can or want to harm you  Like
other venomous animals  arachnids use a lot of
their body's resources to produce venom  So  they
won't waste it unless it's absolutely necessary 
Furthermore  most have fangs that are too small
to penetrate our skin or venom that is too weak to
hurt us  The common house spider  Achaearanea
tepidariorum   for
example  is harmless
to people  In
fact  like many
of its cousins  it's
actually helpful
because it rids our homes of a variety of insect
pests  including houseflies and mosquitoes 
Spiders that can bite people usually do so only
if they are grabbed or otherwise trapped against
our skin  or if they need to protect their egg sacs
or young  Most prefer to run away  Even when
their fangs do pierce our skin  spiders often"dry”
bite they don't expel venom 
Many people think they've been bitten by
spiders when they've actually been zapped by
something else  Spiders tend to bite just once 
A row or group of bites usually means fleas  bed
bugs  mites  or mosquitoes are what got you 

So  which spiders are the big biters? In the
    most painful spider bites come from the
yellow sac spider  Cheiracanthium inclusum   the
red backed jumping spider  Phidippus johnsoni  
and a few other species found around our homes 
A jumping spider's bite may cause localized swelling
and pain  A sac spider's bite can be quite
painful  and the wound may take a long time to
heal  Its venom can also cause headache  fever 
nausea  dizziness  and even shock  But serious
problems from these spider bites are rare 
Only three types of spiders are considered
truly dangerous to people in this country: the
black widow  Latrodectus mactans  and other
widow species  the brown recluse  Loxosceles
reclusa  and some of its relatives  and the hobo
spider  Tegenaria agrestis  
Shiny black with a red hourglass mark on its
belly  the black widow is the best known and most
venomous spider in America  It likes dark places 
including basements  sheds  woodpiles  and outdoor
toilets  where it spins a tangled  criss cross
web  Only the females bite  But do they live up
to their name? Do they really kill and eat their
mates? Yes  occasionally  they do in order to get
enough nourishment to lay eggs  However  when
it comes to harming people  these ladies are
rather shy and tend to run away rather than
attack 

Black widows  found all over the     rarely
kill humans  but they can make us quite sick  causing
not only fever  nausea  and pain  but also high
blood pressure and severely rigid muscles  In the
worst cases  a victim can have trouble breathing  A
black widow's neurotoxic venom is fifteen times
more potent than a rattlesnake's! But it's not as
dangerous to people because a spider injects much
less venom than a snake does 
There are widow species all over the world 
and one of them  the brown widow  Latrodectus
geometricus   which has a yellow hourglass mark 
has now moved into the Mississippi Gulf Coast
region  It probably made its way there from
Florida  hitching a ride with imported plants 
food  furniture  or building materials  The brown
widow is a very timid spider  preferring to curl
up into a ball and drop to the ground as its main
defense  When it does bite  it is to protect its egg
sac  Fortunately  its
venom seems to be
far less potent than
its cousin's and causes
mostly a localized
reaction 

 Although tarantulas eat frogs  as well as insects  lizards 
and small mammals   several species  such as the Colombian
lesser black   Xenesthis immanis    will peacefully share their burrows
with these amphibians  Scientists guess that the frogs
protect the spiders' eggs by eating ants that would otherwise
feed on those eggs  And the spiders protect the frogs from
being eaten by other predators 


The brown recluse lives in the South Central
and the Midwest states  It is found in areas such
as in closets  behind furniture  and on the floor 
People are most likely to be bitten if they put on
clothes or shoes they haven't worn in a while or
if they roll on the spider in bed  The recluse's
venom is necrotoxic  Its bite may be painless
when delivered  but later the area often becomes
swollen and tender and develops into a wound
that takes weeks or even months to heal 
You can recognize a recluse by the violin shaped
mark on its head and back  the neck of
the violin points toward the rear   If you have a
magnifying glass  you can also see that  unlike
most other spiders  it has six eyes instead of eight 
The hobo spider was originally a field dweller
from Europe  It hitched a ride on cargo ships
bound for northwestern America and quickly
adapted to rural areas and small towns with cool 
moist climates  Hobo spiders live in grassy areas 
amid rubble  and around foundations  The males
occasionally enter houses  The effects of its bite
are similar to that of the brown recluse 
The hobo spider is a type of funnel web
weaver  Its flat web has a funnel at the back where
the spider waits for prey  Unlike the webs of many
other spiders  this spider's web isn't sticky  It trips
up the prey's legs  and then the spider dashes out
to bite the victim 
Hobo spiders are generally not aggressive 
But another funnel web weaver  one more related
to the tarantula  is  The Sydney funnel web
spider  Atrax robustus   which nests in shaded
garden areas around Sydney  a large city in
Australia  is quicker to attack particularly the
male  which is five or six times more venomous
than the female  Like a miniature horror movie
monster  the spider rears up and threatens you
right back  with potent venom dripping from
its fangs 
The worst time to meet this arachnid is when
the males are wandering around looking for
mates  The male's neurotoxic venom contains a
special substance called robustoxin  It is not particularly
harmful to dogs or cats  but it can be
fatal to humans and other primates 

clothing or bedding  where they're more likely to
encounter people  They also occasionally fall into swimming
pools  but they don't immediately drown  They can
trap a small air bubble in their abdomen hairs and stay
alive  and capable of biting  for hours underwater 
Because of its potent venom and the fact that it
lives in a city of four million people  this arachnid is one of
the most dangerous spiders in the world  In the past  people
have died from its bite  Fortunately  there is now an
antivenin available to treat victims 
Venoms are necessary for the production of
antivenins  But that's not all they're good for  Scientists are
actively studying spider venoms to discover treatments
and cures for a variety of disorders  For example  they
have isolated a chemical in tarantula venom that may
help stop atrial fibrillation  irregular heartbeat   a major
cause of death 
In addition  spider venom may prove to be a farmer's
good friend  The Blue Mountains funnel web spider
 Hadronyche versuta  is a species whose bite is lethal to
humans and other beings  Australian biochemists have
isolated the neurotoxins in its venom that paralyze
insects  In the venom  there are individual substances
that target specific prey  Scientists are hoping to design
insecticides that will be toxic to bugs  but not to anything
else  The Blue Mountains funnel web spider is not the only
species that may be the source of pest control  There are
thousands of arachnids yet to be studied and quite a few
scientists willing to study them 


Ticks are also arachnids  They can carry a
wide variety of serious diseases  such as Rocky
Mountain spotted fever and Lyme disease 
which are caused by bacteria and other organisms 
not venom  Only one known tick borne
illness is caused by a neurotoxin: tick paralysis 
The tick transmits this neurotoxin through its
saliva as it feeds  and the arachnid has to be
embedded attached to the host for a while to
do so  The symptoms are weakness  lack of muscle
control  and eventual paralysis  which can
lead to respiratory failure and death  Fortunately 
the illness usually clears up if the tick is removed
quickly enough 
To prevent tick bites  veterinarians suggest
insecticides for your pets  For people in tick infested
areas  doctors recommend repellents and
also protective clothing  such as long pants tucked
into your socks 
Although several varieties of ticks carry this
neurotoxin  most don't seem to cause the illness 
However  in Australia there is a species known as
the paralysis tick  Ixodes holocyclus   Dogs  cats 
and people  especially children  have been victims
of its potent toxin  But possums and bandicoots
have not  These two families of Australian mammals
are immune 

In our homes  spiders aren't the only venomous
critters that find good pickings among
the many insects that live with us  Centipedes
 Scutigera  like to make a meal out of common
household bugs  too  In the wild  they like moist
forest floors  In our homes  they've adapted to the
dampness of our bathrooms and basements 
Centipedes are not insects  They have many
body segments and fifteen to one hundred and
fifty pairs of legs to go with them  The first is a
pair of claws called prehensors that have adapted
for grasping prey and injecting venom  Some of
these critters  such as the colorful twelve inch long 
bat eating  rainforest centipede  Scolopendra
gigantea   deliver painful envenomations  The
small house centipede  Scutigera coleoptrata  in
your bathtub may also be able to stab  but it can't
cause you much injury and it gets rid of lots of
pests  including bed bugs!
Millipedes  relatives of the centipedes  have
twenty to one hundred body segments  most
with two pairs of legs each  Living outdoors  they
eat leaves and decaying vegetation  and most are
not venomous at all  They have a tough exoskeleton 
and their main defense is to roll into a tight 
hard ball 
But some species are poisonous  such as the
yellow spotted millipede  Harpaphe haydeniana  
Like a few uncommon centipede species  they
emit acid or liquid hydrogen cyanide a toxin
sometimes featured in murder mysteries to
repel predators  such as ants and toads  Although
millipedes don't discharge enough of these poisons
to hurt people  it's a good idea not to touch
your eyes after handling this species 
Black lemurs  primates found in Madagascar 
and South American capuchin monkeys are known
to rub millipedes on
themselves  using the
poison to repel insect
pests 
Spiders  centipedes 
and millipedes are
helpful animals with
every right to live  But
when it comes to sharing
our house and yard
with these beings  most
of us would probably
prefer roommates that
don't stab  bite  or ooze 

Zipping past your petunias is one of the most
dangerous animals in America one you might
see every summer day  It kills more people in the
   than any other venomous animal  Yet most
of us are happy to see it fly by  because without it
we might not have such lovely petunias at all 
What is this bold critter? None other than the
honeybee  Apis mellifera  
There are different types of bees  Many
spread pollen to help our gardens grow  Some 
such as carpenter bees  Xylocopa   are solitary 
They nest in burrows or holes that the females
carve in dead wood  The bees we are most familiar
with bumblebees  Bombus terrestris  and
honeybees live communally 
Each colony has a strict social structure  The
queen produces eggs  The female workers take
care of the hive  They perform tasks such as gathering
pollen and nectar  making honey  fighting
off intruders  and building and repairing cells out
of wax to store food and house the larvae the
young  The males  called drones  don't work at all 
Nor can they sting  They mate in midair with the
queen and die shortly afterwards 
Almost all bees are vegetarians  living on nectar
and pollen from flowers  They use their venom
strictly to protect themselves or their colonies 
Oddly enough  some stingless bees  Meliponini  
which have no venom at all  are the only meat eaters
in this family  They live on carrion  rotting
flesh  and other animal material instead of pollen
and are nicknamed the"vulture bees ”


The bee's stinger has
developed over time from
what was once its ovipositor 
its egg laying tube  In all but
one species  the honeybee's
stinger is barbed to hook and remain in the victim and to
keep pumping venom  As the bee flies away  the insect's
abdomen tears  and the bee soon dies  Sometimes its victim
dies  too especially if many bees have stung it 
When workers near their hive sense danger  the bees
give off an alarm pheromone a chemical signal they can
detect  This alerts all the hive's inhabitants  and they
become ready to attack if necessary  If any of them do
strike  the glands responsible for producing the alarm
pheromone detach along with the stinger and keep giving
off the signal to attack 
Bee stings are painful for a reason  American entomologist
Justin  Schmidt feels that pain is responsible for the
insect's survival  The pain of the sting fools a predator into
thinking that the bee has caused more serious damage than
it actually has  and thus the victim will avoid it in future 
It's certainly true that although it hurts a lot  the
venom from a single sting is not strong enough to kill
most animals  including humans unless you are allergic
to the venom  Some sources say that as many as four people
in one thousand have systemic reactions to bee stings 
When allergic people are stung  they can go into anaphylactic
shock their whole bodies react so badly that they
may stop breathing  To survive  they need an epinephrine
shot  followed by a trip to the doctor or emergency room 
There are kits with epinephrine syringes available for
people with this allergy  The high number of allergic
people  plus the fact that bees and humans are common
neighbors  explains why these insects are dangerous 


Honeybees were originally brought to the
Americas from Europe in the early seventeenth
century  Then  in 1956  some colonies of African
honeybees were imported to South America to
improve the bee industry in Brazil  This African
variety produced a lot of honey  and the bees
seemed better suited to the warmer climate than
their European relatives  The following year  some
of the bees escaped from an experimental apiary
 the place where beehives are kept   and they
began to interbreed with
the European bees
already living there  The
Africanized honeybees  or
killer bees  were their offspring 
They are now found
in Central America and
parts of the     as well as South America 
The reason they are called killer bees is not
because their venom is any more dangerous than
that of the European bees  It isn't  They got their
name because they defend their colonies more
aggressively  For example  they may attack a person
for approaching too near a hive something
European bees are less likely to do  When they do
attack  killer bees sting in greater numbers and for
a longer time  and they will pursue their enemies
farther from their nest  A person who isn't allergic
to bee venom can  perhaps  survive as many as
three hundred stings  A swarm of killer bees has
been known to deliver ten thousand stings 
Are you likely to be pursued by an American
colony of killer bees? Not really  But let's suppose
a swarm comes after you  What should you do?
You should not jump into water the bees will
be waiting for you when you get out  Instead  get
inside a car or building  or just run! Killer bees
may be fierce and persistent  but they're also slow 
and  even though they fly further from their hive
than European bees  they still don't want to travel
too far  There's a good chance that you can outrace
them though you may have to run several
hundred yards before they give up 


 Many folks insist that
you must never pull out a bee
stinger because squeezing it
will make it pump more venom
into you  They advise scraping
away the stinger with your fingernail  a credit card  or some
other object with an edge  However  in a 1996 article in The
Lancet   the British journal of medicine  the researchers said
that it doesn't matter how  you remove the stinger because
it pumps through a valve system and not by compression 
What is  important is that you get that stinger out fast so it
stops pumping  period 
Whether you've been stung by
a bee or wasp  you should wash the
area  and then put ice on it to
reduce swelling and pain  Calamine
lotion  calendula gel  or other
itch/pain relieving creams may also
help  Some people use teabags 
baking soda paste  or meat tenderizer 
which contains papain   an enzyme that breaks down the
toxins in the venom

Wasps and bees are close relatives  In fact 
bees and ants evolved from wasps  Usually
less hairy than bees  wasps are known for their
very narrow"waists” between the thorax and
abdomen  They do not make honey or wax  and
they have smooth stingers  which means they can
sting over and over without dying 
The wasps we most often encounter are the
social wasps creatures that live in groups such
as hornets  Vespa   yellow jackets  Vespula   and
paper wasps  Polistes   All of them make different
types of papery nests  sometimes in troublesome
places  such as on door hinges  inside porch
lights  or under tables  Disturb a well developed
nest  and you could get zapped 
Solitary wasps critters that live alone can
also sting in self defense  but they mainly use
their venom to paralyze spiders or insects  Like
bees  these wasps feed largely on nectar when
they are adults  As babies  they need a lot more
protein  and that means meat 
The great golden digger wasp  Sphex ichneumoneus 
will sting prey  such as a katydid  and then
drag the victim into its burrow nest in the ground 
The tarantula hawk  aka tarantula wasp  example:
Pepsis formosa   a desert species  will attack a tarantula
many times its size  paralyze the spider  and
manage to lug it to the spider's nest  or sometimes
the wasp's own burrow  This wasp's sting is especially
painful to people  though not lethal 
A potter wasp  Eumenes  or a mud dauber
wasp  Trypoxylon politum  carries its prey a spider
or insect  depending on the wasp species 
into its pot or pipe shaped clay nest  which is
often found on buildings  Then  the wasp lays an
egg  generally on the prey  When the egg hatches 
the larva eats the meat  The
paralyzed  but still living prey
is not only high in protein  but
also fresh 

It looks like a hairy ant  It crawls on the
ground like a hairy ant  But the velvet ant
 example: Dasymutilla occidentalis  is actually a
solitary wasp  Males are winged  but females are
wingless  In most species  females parasitize
other solitary wasps  as well as solitary bees 
They enter their victims' nests  open the cells
where the larvae are developing  and lay eggs on
them so their youngsters can hatch and feed on
these insects 
Adult velvet ants drink mostly nectar  They
are not aggressive creatures  They try to run
from enemies  and they make squeaking sounds
when disturbed  In America  the velvet ant's
painful venomous sting has earned it the nickname
“cow killer ” although it really can't kill
any cattle 
In Africa  two species of velvet ants parasitize
tsetse flies  Glossina   which carry sleeping sickness 
a serious disease that affects horses  cattle 
and people  Scientists hope that velvet ants may
someday be used as the biological control of these
harmful flies 
Although there are many species of solid colored
wasps and bees  when we think of these
insects  we think of flashy stripes: orange and black
or yellow and black  These colors and patterns are
aposematic they warn enemies that these critters
are venomous  Once a bird  amphibian  or other
predator attempts to sample a stinging wasp or
bee  it will hesitate to try another  The sacrifice of
a few insects ensures the survival of many more 


Aposematism is a useful device  So is mimicry 
animals imitating other animals  Some nonvenomous
creatures imitate venomous ones  Wasps
and bees have many stingless mimics  Several of
these copycats  such as the American hover fly
 Metasyrphus americanus  and its relatives  use
their colors to protect themselves from being
eaten by birds and reptiles  Certain robber flies
 example: Dasyllis haemorrhoa  look just like honeybees
so they can stalk and eat the bees  But if
you examine these mimics  you'll see that  like all
flies  they have one pair of wings instead of the
two pairs that bees and wasps possess 
Other garden insects' warning colors announce
that they are poisonous to eat  The poison is generally
not strong enough to kill predators  It makes
more sense for the survival of a species to sicken 
not slaughter enemies so they'll learn to avoid this
prey in the future 
The most familiar of these aposematic insects
are two garden favorites: the orange and black
ladybug  example: Coccinella septempunctata  
which is a type of beetle  and the monarch butterfly
 Danaus plexippus  
Who doesn't
like ladybugs?
Aphids because
ladybugs eat them 
But neither do
many frogs  toads 
birds  and lizards 
Ladybugs taste terrible!
If the beetle's
warning coloration
isn't enough to deter a
hunter  it will reflex bleed  which means it will ooze
yellowish blood from its leg joints  The fluid contains
toxins and has a bad odor  A predator will
quickly realize by smell  taste  or both that a ladybug
is bad eats 
The monarch butterfly feeds on nectar from
a variety of flowers  But in its caterpillar stage  it
eats only toxic milkweed leaves and  as a result  it
too becomes toxic and remains toxic  right into
adulthood  Birds and other beings that taste this
butterfly learn from its Halloween colors that they
don't want a second bite 


Other butterflies and their
close relatives also become poisonous
from their diet  Among these
are various species of tiger moths
of the Arctiidae family  many of
which are aposematic  If they are
touched  some secrete poisonous
foam from glands in their thorax 
Spiders and other predators will avoid these insects  It's a good
idea for people to avoid touching these foaming flyers  too  as
the froth of certain species can burn human skin 
Rattlebox moths  Utetheisa ornatrix  are members of the
frothing tiger moth clan  The females get a unique wedding
present from the males  The female moths are born toxic  but
as they reach reproductive age  they
need more toxins to protect their many
eggs from certain wasps that attack
them  During mating  males transmit
this extra poison to the females  and
the females  in turn  pass it to the eggs 


Insects are popular prey  so they've had to develop
many forms of protection in order to survive  and that
means quite a few are bound to be toxic  Some  like the
monarchs and the tiger moths  are poisonous  Others 
such as the io moth  Automeris io  and saddleback caterpillars
 Sibine stimule   are urticating insects with spines
that easily break off  And in their case  the spines contain
toxins that pour out to irritate predators  making human
skin itch and burn 
The spines of the cute puss moth caterpillar
 Megalopyge opercularis  are covered with a thick coat
of reddish brown hairs  This caterpillar's toxins are the
most severe  Besides getting a skin rash  its victims may
experience headaches  nausea  weakness  and shock 
Adult moths don't have venomous spines  but the
females of some species will gather the spines from their
own cast off caterpillar skins and use them to cover and
protect their eggs with a cozy  toxic quilt!


Blister beetles
 example: Epicauta
fabricii  will eat
your flowers or
your vegetables 
but predators can't
eat them  They're
poisonous  If you
handle them  some species will ooze the toxic
substance  cantharidin  from their legs  This
chemical will raise blisters on your skin  but the
same toxin is used in ointments to cure warts!
Some animals  such as hedgehogs  frogs  and
a variety of spiders  can tolerate cantharidin  One
insect that's known to thrive on it is the fire colored
beetle  Neopyrochroa flabellata  It eats the
chemical to protect itself from predators  A male
will secrete some
between its eyes
and offer this
toxic treat to a
female  If she
accepts his gift 
he'll transmit another load of cantharidin when
they mate  Like the rattlebox moth  the female
fire colored beetle then passes on the poison to
her eggs 
Some assassin bugs can stomach monarch
butterflies  Some eat other insects  And a few
feast on human blood  As their name suggests 
they hunt very quickly  All assassin bugs have a
sharp  curved rostrum 
or beak  to
pierce their prey 
Within the rostrum
are several
fused stylets needle 
like tubes that
are used to inject
venom  which paralyzes and liquefies the victim 
and then to suck up the prey  One species  the
wheel bug  Arilus cristatus   has such fast acting
venom that  once bitten  a caterpillar more than
four hundred times this predator's weight can die
in just ten seconds 
Some assassin bugs
can pierce human skin 
The wheel bug's bite
is said to be the most
painful of any insect 
But it isn't eager to
bite you  More dangerous is another species 
the bloodsucking conenose  Triatoma sanguisuga 
found in Central and South America  where it
enters homes to feed on human blood  It is nicknamed
the"kissing bug ” because it can painlessly
pierce a victim's lips  eyelids  or ears  What makes
it dangerous is not its venom  but Chagas disease 
that can be transmitted through its feces  which
it sometimes deposits on the person it bites  This
illness may result in heart and digestive problems
and even death 



The most dangerous insect perhaps the most dangerous
animal in the world has no stinger or spines  In fact  it's not
venomous or poisonous at all  yet it sickens or kills 700 000 000
people worldwide each year  and countless other animals  as
well  What is this scary creature? A female mosquito  example:
Anopheles punctipennis  
There are many species of mosquitoes  All of them develop
in water or moisture  The larvae hatch from eggs  grow  pupate 
and emerge a week later as adults  Males feed on nectar  Females
also feed on nectar  but most need blood to produce eggs  and
they don't care where it comes from a lion  a deer  a robin  a
poodle  or you 
They find their victims by sensing body heat  sweat  and carbon
dioxide  given off when we breathe  They use their sharp 
needle like proboscis tubular mouth with fused stylets to
inject saliva that contains anticoagulants  substances to keep the
victim's blood from clotting  and to draw up that blood 
Through its saliva  mosquitoes can transmit a host of diseases
and parasites  including yellow fever  malaria  West Nile fever 
encephalitis  and heartworms  Not all mosquitoes cause disease 
but their itchy bites can make our days and nights miserable 
So what are mosquitoes good for? Food! That may not
please you  but it does please bats  dragonflies  frogs  toads  and
many other animals  both toxic and non toxic  that feast on
these whining flies 



What's a picnic without sandwiches  chips 
lemonade  and       venom? Who's bringing the
toxins? Ants  of course 
Ants are members of the same order as bees
and wasps  But while some bees and wasps are
solitary  ants  on the other hand  are always
social  Their nests are found underground  in
trees  and in buildings  Some species live in large 
well ordered colonies that may number in the
millions  Colonies may even join together to
form super colonies  covering a wide area of land 
Female workers are wingless  Males and young
queens have wings  and  among many colonies
during mating season  they fly out to establish
new nests and colonies  Then the wings drop off
or are pulled off 
Ants are found in grasslands  as well as
deserts  temperate woodlands  and rainforests 
Most of them are harmless  such as the little


In America  the nastiest of these stingers may
well be imported fire ants  Solenopsis invicta and
Solenopsis richteri   Fire ants arrived in the   
by hitching rides on ships from South America 
They build big mound nests  two feet wide and
up to three feet high  in fields and lawns  They
are especially fond of golf courses  Worker ants
exit from tunnels that can extend as much as ten
yards from the mound  They are omnivorous
and will use their venom to paralyze or kill many
kinds of small ground nesting animals for food 
They also aggressively defend their nests 
When an enemy threatens  a fire ant will clamp
on with its jaws and spin in a circle  stinging
over and over with its rear end  A single fire ant's
stings cause itchy  burning blisters  but they're
usually not deadly  However  when one ant
stings  its alarm pheromone alerts the other ants 
which come rushing out of the ground  No animal
wants to face a whole colony of two hundred
thousand stinging ants!



Some people confuse red harvester ants  Pogonomyrmex
barbatus   the native American species usually sold for ant
farms  with fire ants  They can also sting  but they are nonaggressive
and non invasive they don't take over other
species' habitats  In fact  they are being driven out by the
imported fire ants in parts of the country  The decline of
this species has led  in part  to the decline of its predator 
the Texas horned lizard  In addition  the lizard and its eggs
are the prey of the fire ants 
Imported fire ants have invaded other countries  too 
Australia is currently doing battle with these pests  This
continent already has its share of fierce stingers  including
the bulldog or jumping ants  Myrmecia   known for
their huge jaws and savage grip  Along with the fire ants 
the bulldog ants have surely ruined more than one picnic 
However  recent studies suggest that their toxins may also
hold the key to lowering high blood pressure  So perhaps
some picnickers will forgive them 



Ants are social not only near their nests  Sometimes they
travel together to hunt and no group of marching ants forms
a scarier image than the army ants  Eciton burchelli  of South
and Central America  They migrate regularly to find new
camping and hunting grounds  For two or three nights  in
groups of one hundred thousand to two million  they march 
moving in organized patterns  attacking animals in their path 
First  they sting their victims  and then they tear them apart
with jaws so powerful that native Central American people
have used the ants as sutures to hold wounds together until
they healed 
Army ants mostly eat insects and spiders about fifty
thousand in a single day but they have been known to attack
mice  rats  snakes  birds  and even large mammals  Their victims
often die of shock 
Do these ants devour people? No  No matter what you see
in Hollywood movies  people can easily step aside and watch
the ants pass a parade that may take hours  Even when the
ants enter houses  the human inhabitants can just take their
livestock and leave and thank the ants for clearing their
homes of vermin  The truth is that these insects are threatened
by people rather than vice versa  as we claim more and
more of their habitat for human use 

Jason Schmidt has been stung by almost every bee  wasp  and ant
in the world  so he created the"Schmidt Sting Pain Index” to describe the
type and severity of the pain from different kinds of stings  According to
Schmidt  the bullhorn acacia ant's sting is worse than the fire ant's  the
red harvester's is more painful than the acacia ant's  and the bullet ant's is
the mother of all stings!
Folks who have been stung by Central and South American bullet
ants  Paraponera clavata  say the sensation is like being shot by a bullet 
and the severe pain  accompanied by trembling of the injured limb  can
last for a whole day  In the past  certain South American native people
used these ants in initiation ceremonies  Boys would intentionally be
stung by the insects  To prove that they were men  they had to show no
sign of pain  That's a tough way to say "I'm a grown up ”


Wood ants  Formica   found on
forest floors  and carpenter ants
 Camponotus   which live in dead
trees and also buildings  are not
stingers they're sprayers  A spraying
ant will grab hold of its prey or
enemy with its jaws  Then  depending
on the species  it will either tuck
its abdomen under its legs or raise it
over its back and squirt formic acid 
This pungent toxic liquid is powerful
stuff  It can repel and even kill animals  But
spraying ants usually won't spray unless they're
also biting  An ant predator called the antlion
 Myrmeleon  can capture and feed on these ants
while preventing them from spraying 
Some species of antlions dig a shallow coneshaped
pit in sand  The antlion then waits at
the bottom of the trap for its prey to fall in and
attacks before the ant has a chance to bite  and
therefore spray  It usually helps the prey slide
down the tunnel by flipping sand at the ant with
its huge jaws and head  Antlions are also called
“doodlebugs” because they make artistic looking
trails in the sand as they search for the best place
to dig their pit 


Formic acid can also kill plants  In the Amazon
rainforest there are areas in which all but one species
of plants are dead  They're called"devil's gardens ”
Some native people believed that evil spirits tended
these gardens  Scientists have recently discovered
that these spirits are none other than ants lemon
ants  Myrmelachista schumanni   to be precise  They
colonize certain trees  which they prefer for their
hollow stems  and spray formic acid as an herbicide
to rid their territory of competing plants  One lemon
ant garden is more than a third of an acre in size and
approximately eight hundred years old 
In the early twentieth century  yellow crazy ants
 Anoplolepis gracilipes  were accidentally introduced
on Christmas Island in the Pacific Ocean  Thanks to
their formic acid  these insects  named for their frantic
movements when disturbed  changed the island's
entire ecosystem 
Land crabs used to migrate in great numbers
across the land  When they moved through areas
infested with the yellow crazy ants  the ants thought
the crabs were enemies  The insects sprayed so much
formic acid that fifteen to twenty million crabs were
blinded and then killed  Seedlings and weeds that
used to be eaten by the crabs thrived  displacing other
animals and plants  The parks service there has now
succeeded in finding a poison that destroys the ants
but doesn't harm any other animals  and the island's
ecological balance is being restored 

Crawling through fields  meadows  and dry
grasslands called savannahs is another group of biters
and sprayers  To many people  they're the scariest
animals of all  They are snakes 
Snakes live in a wide variety of habitats besides
savannahs deserts  rainforests  woodlands  and even
your backyard  They come in many colors and
lengths  but none of them are slimy  They are reptiles 
cold blooded animals with backbones and dry 
scaly skin  Some snakes  like other reptiles  lay eggs 
others bear live young  All are carnivorous 
It was formerly believed that of the nearly three
thousand species of snakes  only three hundred were
venomous  But recent research indicates that most
snakes can produce venom although the majority
are too small or too shy or are physically unable to
inject the venom into us 


Dr  Bryan Fry  biologist at the University
of Melbourne  Australia  says it was venom 
He believes that it existed two hundred million
years ago one hundred million years before the
first snakes appeared  A common ancestor of
snakes and lizards had venom  which it dispensed
through its upper and lower jaws  As snakes
evolved  each family developed its own venom 
a brew of old and new toxins  delivered only
through teeth in their upper jaws 
The earliest venomous snakes most likely had
enlarged  grooved rear teeth that were located
below glands that secreted toxic saliva to help subdue
prey  These reptiles were the opisthoglyphs 
the rear fanged snakes  Then  according to one
theory  the snakes' jaws got smaller  and the rear
fangs moved to the front of their mouths  The
grooves deepened and connected to form short 
fixed hollow tubes  And the proteroglyphs front fanged
snakes appeared  Eventually these fangs
lengthened  In fact  they became so long that
snakes could not close their mouths unless they
could also fold their fangs  and so the solenoglyphs
 the vipers evolved 
Because snake skeletons are fragile  fossil evidence
is inconclusive  Newer methods of investigation
using DNA may reveal more information
about snake evolution 


Ophidiphobia  It means"fear of snakes ” People
acquire it from parents  other relatives  friends  television 
and movies  Or do they? Some scientists think
humans have been programmed for millions of years
to fear these reptiles  They believe that our mammalian
ancestors  who lived in a time when reptiles
dominated the world  developed a healthy respect for
these critters  and that they genetically passed the
fear along to us 
It's true that about fifty thousand people currently
die each year from snakebites  But it's also true that
as much as we fear snakes  they fear us a lot more 
Most are not aggressive  and they prefer to crawl
away from  not toward  us  Sad to say  these fascinating
animals are persecuted and also hunted for their
skins  No wonder they've developed anthropophobia 
fear of people 

Not all snakes use venom to kill their victims 
Some snakes use constriction they seize the prey
with their small  backward pointing teeth  then
quickly wrap themselves around the victim and
tighten their muscles to suffocate it  The most
famous of these constrictors are the pythons and
boas 
Like the constrictors  venomous snakes have
“regular” teeth to seize prey and to prevent it
from slipping out of their mouths  but they also
have a pair of hollow fangs in their upper jaws to
inject toxins  If a snake loses a fang  another one
usually replaces it  sometimes as often as once a
week  Baby venomous snakes are born with fangs
and the ability to inject venom  They will shed
teeth and fangs many times during their lives 
Some snakes bite and hold their prey  chewing
to inject venom deep in the wound  Others
strike and quickly withdraw  As for a snake's
forked tongue  it cannot sting it is used to taste/
smell the air to find food 
Snake venom has to work quickly and efficiently
to subdue prey  That's why it is so potent 
A struggling victim is dangerous not only when
it is caught  but also when it is swallowed  It
could easily break the snake's ribs or skull  So the
snake waits until the prey is paralyzed  tracks it
by smell  and then swallows it  A snake's jaws are
connected by stretchy skin and ligaments so it can
open its mouth very wide  The two sides of the
jaws work independently "walking” the prey to
the rear of the snake's mouth and down its throat



A snake's venom is actually modified saliva 
It is produced in special glands below and
behind the snake's eyes  and it flows into tissues
surrounding the base of the fangs  and
then into the fangs' venom canals  It is mostly
made up of proteins in the form of enzymes
that help break down the prey quickly  In one
study  a venomous snake called a fer de lance
 Bothrops asper  found in Central and South
American rainforests  clearings  and fields had
its venom removed  Instead of the two or three
days the snake usually needed to digest a rat  it
took this snake twelve days 
Studies of Bothrops venom have also resulted
in the discovery of beta blockers drugs used
to treat cardiovascular diseases  In fact  snake
venom components are used in many areas of
medicine  From cobra venom  scientists have
developed several painkillers  Other venoms
have produced anticoagulants that prevent blood
clots  Venoms are currently being investigated
for their potential to kill harmful viruses and
bacteria and to treat other cardiovascular 
nerve  muscular  and joint diseases  as well as
visual disorders 
A copperhead uses its fangs



Today  all three categories of
venomous snakes are still around 
the rear fanged and the two front fanged
types  fixed and folding 
and they're found in grasslands  as
well as many other habitats  all over
the world 
Rear fanged snakes inject venom
as they"chew” their prey  They include
the Asian forest dwelling green vine
snake  Ahaetulla nasuta  and the
African boomslang  Dispholidus typus 
of the savannahs  Most rear fanged snakes are not
as dangerous to humans as front fanged snakes 
Among the front fanged snakes with fixed
fangs are kraits  sea snakes  brown snakes  taipans 
mambas  death adders  and the famous
cobras  All of these snakes can bite  but some
cobras are also known for their ability to shoot
venom through openings in their fangs  They
are the spitting cobras  example: Naja nigricollis
nigricincta   many of which are found on
the savannahs and grasslands of
Africa and Asia  The openings in
their fangs are somewhat shorter
and rounder than those of nonspitters 
Spitting cobras spray only in
self defense  When a cobra is about
to spurt  it rises up  spreads its hood 
and aims with great accuracy at an
enemy's eyes  The spray can travel more
than ten feet to blind the attacker 
People who have been sprayed need
to flush out their eyes with water immediately to
prevent damage  Some scientists believe that this
spraying behavior developed as the snakes' way
of avoiding being trampled by antelopes  which
share the same territory 
To catch prey  a spitting cobra does not spit 
It injects neurotoxic venom with its fixed fangs 
just like its non spitting  twelve to eighteen foot
cousin  the Asian king cobra  Ophiophagus hannah  
the longest venomous snake in the world 




Cobra venom is very strong indeed  but other fixed fang
snakes have even more powerful venoms  These include the
sea snakes  example: Aipysurus laevis   found in the Pacific
and Indian oceans  and the Australian desert dwelling inland
taipan  Oxyuranus microlepidotus   The venom in one bite of
an inland taipan  also called the fierce snake  can kill two
hundred thousand mice  or approximately sixty two humans 
However  none of these species are aggressive  and they are
less likely to encounter people than cobras or terrestrial  land based 
kraits  example: Bungarus fasciatus   which sometimes
enter people's homes and are responsible for a great number
of envenomations and some deaths



 The man in the turban sits cross legged on the ground  In
front of him is a closed basket  He removes the lid and begins to
play the flute  From the basket  a cobra begins to rise  The snake
spreads its hood and sways to and fro to the tune  Then  as if on
cue  the snake charmer stops playing and the snake disappears
back into its container  Hypnosis? Magic? Biology!
When the basket cover is removed  the snake is startled by
the sudden light and by the charmer waving his flute overhead 
It rises defensively  following the movement of the flute with
its body  It cannot hear the tune because all snakes are deaf 
but it may feel the vibrations  Its"dance” is threatening  but it
doesn't attack because it prefers to scare off a possible predator
rather than fight or bite  Furthermore  it can't strike upwards 
only downwards  and the charmer is probably out of striking
range anyway  If it does strike  the charmer doesn't usually suffer
severely  perhaps because he has become immune to the
venom or because the snake has delivered a dry bite  When the
charmer stops waving the flute  the snake no longer needs its
threat display  and it retreats to safety and darkness 
Snake charming was once promoted in India and other countries
for tourism  But animal rights groups have had an impact on
the practice  Most snake charmers treat their animals well  but others
are cruel to these reptiles  They remove the venom glands or
fangs or even sew shut the snakes' mouths  Today  snake charming
is no longer legal  but the Indian government and animal rights
groups  along with the charmers  are examining the possibility of
the snake handlers becoming reptile rescuers and educators  as
well as practitioners who treat cases of snakebite 


Besides the inland taipan and its cousin 
the common taipan  Oxyuranus scutellatus
scutellatus   Australia is home to
some of the other most venomous snakes
in the world  One is the death adder
 example: Acanthophis antarcticus   which
tends to stay put when prey  or people 
approach  Others include the timid tiger
snake  Notechis scutatus  and the eastern
brown snake  Pseudonaja textilis   which
can be found in pastures and farmlands 
among other habitats  The latter has
been responsible for the most deaths by
snakebite in that country but  thanks to
antivenin  that number has been greatly
reduced to one or two per year 
The brown snake's venom is twelve
times more powerful than a cobra's  and
it has a fascinating ingredient: a procoagulant 
an agent that causes big blood clots
to form  After a serious accident or during
surgery  it's essential to get blood to clot
quickly  Scientists believe that they can
eventually create a spray made from the
brown snake's procoagulant that can stop
bleeding  It seems that this reptile's future
is to save rather than take human lives 


In Africa  another dangerous fixed fang
snake  which sometimes finds its way into
folks' homes  is the savannah dwelling black
mamba  Dendroaspis polylepis   It hunts during
the day and is one of the world's fastest moving
snakes  It is at home on both the
ground and in the trees  often at the level
of a person's head  and it sometimes enters
abodes to search for food  It does not seek to
bite people  but it will strike to protect itself
and its home 
Mamba venom is particularly strong 
containing both neuro  and cardiotoxins
that affect the nerves and the heart  As little
as two drops of its venom can kill a human 
and mambas can have as many as twenty
drops in their fangs  Fortunately  an available
antivenin has significantly reduced the number
of human deaths caused by mamba bites 



Many animals prey on young snakes  Some  including people  even
feed on full grown reptiles   Some folks claim that snake meat tastes
like chicken   The mongoose   Herpestes   eats a variety of foods  but it
is famous for killing African and Asian cobras  This mammal is fast and
agile  and its sharp teeth can break a snake's spine  Its thick fur protects
it from snakebite  and  though it is not immune to the venom  it probably
has a high tolerance to it 
The secretary bird   Sagittarius serpentarius   also has a varied diet 
but it is known as the foe of mambas and other terrestrial African snakes 
Named for the feathers on its head that resemble the quill pens that
secretaries used to stick behind their ears many years ago  this bird of
prey walks up to twenty miles a day in search of food  When it finds a
snake  the bird grabs the reptile with its strong toes and stamps on it or
beats it to death on the ground  while protecting itself from bites with
its large wings 
Snakes feed on other snakes  too  The king cobra is a snake eater 
So is the American king snake   Example: Lampropeltis getula    found in
a wide range of habitats from swamps to deserts  It kills by constriction
and is immune to venom  so it can feed on venomous snakes  along with
other delicacies  such as lizards  small mammals  and eggs  King snakes
have been known to
swallow rattlesnakes
equal to their own
length  That's one
large meal!

Vipers are the folding fang snakes  In Asia  a
deadly grassland biter is the Russell's viper  Daboia
russelii   It is responsible for thousands of deaths
throughout its range  The Russell's viper is an abundant
species that often lives in rice fields  so farmers
are sometimes bitten when the rice is being planted
and harvested  The toxins affect the kidneys and
prevent blood from clotting 
But getting rid of snakes from these fields isn't
a good answer  History has shown that in places
where snakes have been eliminated  populations of
rodents and other vermin explode  and crops  stored
grains  and other food get destroyed  Rodents are
also carriers of many diseases  so snakes are a good
biological control to prevent epidemics 
In both Asia and Africa  one of the most feared
terrestrial snakes is the saw scaled viper  Echis carinatus  
also known as a carpet viper  According to
The Guinness Book of World Records  this species is
responsible for more human deaths than any other
snake nearly fifty people per million each year 
Found in a wide variety of environments  this
viper has scales on its sides that resemble saw teeth 
It warns enemies by rubbing the scales together 
making a loud hissing sound like an air leak  The
saw scaled viper is known for its nervous nature 
which makes it quicker to attack than most other
snakes  Its potent venom is both neurotoxic and
hemotoxic 


In the     more people are bitten by copperheads
 Agkistrodon contortrix  than by other
venomous snakes  These terrestrial vipers are
the most common venomous snakes in America
and are widespread  They live in grassy fields 
forests  mountains  and dry lands  as well as
by streams and waterways often near homes
and towns  But because their fangs are short
and their venom is mild  copperheads kill few
people 
In fact  copperheads may soon save many
lives  Scientists have isolated a protein called
contortrostatin in their venom  which shows
great promise in stopping both the growth and
spread of breast and other cancers 
Fortunately  few people die of snakebites 
period  because the venom is meant for much
smaller animals  Like spiders  venomous snakes
often give people "dry” bites with no venom 
they don't want to waste it on animals they can't
eat  However  even if you're not a rat or a sparrow 
it's still smart to let that snake in the grass
quietly pass

what to do in case of snakebite
copperhead
get away although it helps to identify the snake it's more important to avoid further bites by getting
the victim away from the animal so never attempt to capture it

calm down according to the american red cross you should relax the patient and calmly remove any clothing 
or jewelry from the limb where the bit occurred

clean up wash the wound with soap and water but nothing else
stay still
immobilize the limb and keep it lower than the heart to minimize the risk of venom reaching the heart
and other organs

get help
get medical help immediately this is most important especially if you suspect the snake is venomous the red
cross also says that if no medical help is available within thirty minutes an elastic bandage or even clothing
strips or pantyhose wrapped around the limb may slow down venom circulation the bandage
should be the same pressure you'd use to wrap a sprain it should not cut off blood flow

don't don't don't no matter what you've seen in fictional movies or tv show never ever cut the wound 
attempt to suck out the venom use a tourniquet a tight band to stop bleeding or electric shock apply ice
to the bite or give the patient food drink or painkillers these treatments may be harmful resulting in the loss
of a limb or other injuries


A lizard that spends much of its time underground to
escape the desert heat  the Gila monster  Heloderma suspectum 
must come out to feed  And when it does  this lizard grabs
hold with its teeth and hangs on like a pit bull  Its painful
bite can kill its prey or make a larger enemy like you feel
dizzy and weak 
The Gila monster has grooved teeth that are connected to
venom glands in its lower jaw  It needs to hold onto a victim
and chew in order to deliver its neurotoxic venom  This is a
slow method  so scientists believe that the lizard's venom is
mainly for self defense  rather than predation  It is rarely  if
ever  fatal to people 
In fact  the venom is now being used to help some people
who have diabetes  a disorder in which the body can't control
blood sugar because it doesn't produce or properly use the
hormone insulin  Patients with this disease sometimes have
to inject themselves with the hormone  The problem with
injected insulin is that it can make the blood sugar level too
low instead of too high  Though the Gila monster eats one big
meal and then fasts for months  its blood sugar always stays at


the same level  This fact led
Dr  John Eng to investigate the
reptile's venom and to discover
a hormone that forces blood cells
to deal with sugar overload  but
stops working when the right sugar
level is reached  It also helps diabetics
lose weight  The Gila monster drug is
already on the market and proving to be highly
successful  Dr  Eng and millions of diabetics are
giving thanks to one beautiful lizard 
For a long time  the Gila monster  found in
the Mojave  Sonoran  and Chihuahuan deserts 
and its Latin American cousin  the Mexican
beaded lizard  Heloderma horridum  were thought
to be the only venomous lizards in the world 
People who have been bitten by other lizards
often develop pain  swelling  and prolonged
bleeding  but scientists used to think that the
cause was the bacteria in the lizards' mouths 
However  Dr  Bryan Fry's recent research suggests
that forest dwelling iguanas  Iguana  and
monitor lizards  Varanus   such as the largest
lizard of all  the Komodo dragon  Varanus komodoensis 
of Indonesia  also produce venom  but
not in quantities sufficient to harm us seriously 
Perhaps the venom is responsible for some of the
painful bites or perhaps it is a combination of
venom and bacteria

you're a cold blooded snake

like all reptiles
lizards and snakes are cold blooded animals
that means they don't keep a constant body temperature
the way birds and mammals do
desert lizards and snakes need to be 
warmed by the sun so they can move digest food hunt and mate but if they
were to stay in the sun all day
they'd fry so these reptiles need
to escape into burrows 
under rocks or beneath the sand when the air gets too hot
many hunt at night when it's cooler and then 
catch some rays in the morning before
hiding out during the hottest hours of the day





Lizards don't have fangs to inject venom
quickly and efficiently  but desert rattlesnakes
 Crotalus  do  Like copperheads  rattlesnakes
are pit vipers they have heat sensing openings
between their eyes and nostrils to detect prey  In
addition  like many snakes  they use camouflage
to hide from prey  But camouflage can be a problem
when big enemies appear  So these snakes
shake their rattles to warn horses  cattle  people 
and other large animals not to step on them  If the
rattling doesn't work  then they strike  injecting
hemotoxic venom that destroys tissues and organs
and disrupts blood clotting  It isn't true that they
must coil into an  shape to strike  and they can
lunge almost faster than the human eye can see 
Many snakes lay eggs  but rattlers give birth to
live young  The babies have short fangs  but are
venomous and dangerous perhaps even more
dangerous than adults  They don't have rattles to
warn enemies  so when disturbed  they immediately
become defensive and may strike repeatedly 
Though they produce less venom  it appears to
have a higher concentration of toxins  In addition 
young snakes haven't yet learned what is and is not
a serious threat  and they tend to deliver a full
dose rather than a dry bite 
Rattlesnake bites from babies or adults are
always serious  and sometimes fatal  though antivenins
have significantly reduced deaths from
them 
Rattlesnakes have many non venomous mimics 
Gopher snakes  Pituophis melanoleuces   rat
snake   Elaphe  and racers  Example: Coluber
constrictor  vibrate their rattle less tails in dry
grass or leaves to make rattle like sounds  From
their underground homes  burrowing owls  Athene
cunicularia  make rattling hisses that have fooled
folks into thinking they're reptiles  not birds 
Snakes and lizards are found in a wide variety
of habitats  but they are often associated with the
desert  So are tarantulas and scorpions 



Deserts are regions with very little rainfall 
They cover one fifth of the earth's surface  Some
are cool places that may even have snowfall in
winter  but we're most familiar with the deserts
that are hot  such as the American Mojave or the
African Sahara  Because of the burning  shifting
sands  it's hard for animals to travel across the
desert  One type of rattlesnake that has found
a solution is the American sidewinder  Crotalus
cerastes   This species of rattlesnake loops sideways
over the dunes  with just two spots of its
body touching the sand at any one time  Using
this unique locomotion  the sidewinder can move
quickly to prey on rodents  lizards  and sometimes
birds  leaving a series of  shaped tracks in
the sand 
Sidewinders have "horns” scales that stick
out over their eyes to protect them from grit as
they enter their underground burrows  Some
Saharan and other desert snakes also have these
horns and use the side winding motion to travel

if you answered you're right the aculeus is the stinger at the end of the 
scorpion's telson the last fat segment of its
long tail like abdomen where its venom glands are found
the pedipalps are its huge claws or pincers
the chelicerae are its mouth parts but unlike
a spider's a scorpion's chelicerae don't end in fangs

the mesosoma is the main part of its body
the metasoma is the entire tail section 
the scorpion has eight harmless legs and no earlobes
 whatsoever

Scorpions are nocturnal arachnids that glow
in the dark  They use their pincers to grab insects 
worms  lizards  mice  and other scorpions  They
inject neurotoxic venom into their prey  as well
as their enemies  with stingers on their rear ends 
Recent research indicates that some  and perhaps
all  scorpions  example: Parabuthus transvaalicus 
have a thick venom and a thinner prevenom 
Venom is made up mostly of protein  and it
requires a lot energy to produce  Scorpions need
venom to subdue larger  more dangerous prey or
to escape from enemies that won't leave them
alone  Prevenom has less protein and requires less
energy to make  It works against smaller  nonthreatening
species and it causes greater pain  A
mouse that receives a dose of prevenom will jump
around  then stop to nurse its injected limb  giving
the scorpion a chance to get away  Scientists
now want to study other venomous animals to see
if they  too  produce prevenom 
Eons ago some scorpions were huge three
feet long! Now the largest one  the emperor scorpion
 Pandinus imperator  of North Africa  is only
eight inches long still big  but not gigantic  But
these large emperors rarely sting people  In fact 
they are sometimes kept as pets and unfortunately 
over collecting is responsible for their
decline in the wild 

emperor scorpion
a scorpion aculeus
love me love my stinger

when scorpions mate they seem to dance the male who is smaller grasps the female's pedipalps and leads
her around sometimes for as long as an hour during the dance a male may sting a female no one is sure why but
the most likely reason is that he needs to subdue her and make sure she doesn't eat him while they mate




Far more dangerous to people are the two inch 
long bark scorpions  Centruroides exilicauda  
the only deadly scorpion species in the 
and the two  to four inch long Sahara scorpions
 example: Androctonus australis   which are probably
the deadliest scorpions in the world  Scorpions
with big  strong pincers  such as the emperors 
usually rely on grabbing and eating their prey
instead of envenoming it first  The deadly species
have narrower and weaker pincers 
Despite their venom  scorpions are eaten by
lizards  mongooses  burrowing owls  and other
animals  These predators bite or break off the
scorpion's metasoma first  This just goes to prove
that in the desert and everywhere else poison
only works if you get a chance to use it 

 Scientists and other folks who are interested in
scorpions can find them at night in their natural habitats
by using handheld black lights that produce ultraviolet
 UV  light  When exposed to this light  scorpions
fluoresce   A thin  transparent film called hyaline  found
in their cuticle  the outermost layer of their exoskeleton 
contains a special protein that allows them to
glow green blue or green yellow in the dark  When
scorpions molt  shed their exoskeleton as they grow 
they do not glow until their new cuticle hardens 
Why do  they glow? Scientists are not sure  One
theory is that scorpions can see fluorescence without
the aid of UV light and  therefore  they can find or avoid
each other  But some scientists doubt the ability of
these arachnids to see the glow  Another theory is that
there are other nocturnal predators capable of detecting
this fluorescence  allowing them to spot and stay
away from these venomous arachnids 


Doctors have created a synthetic version of a
protein found in the venom of the giant yellow
Israeli scorpion or death stalker  Leiurus quinquestriatus 
to fight a type of brain tumor  The
protein can deliver radioactive iodine  a chemotherapy
agent  directly to the cancerous cells to
kill them while leaving the healthy cells alone  It
might also have cancer fighting properties itself 
As one doctor said "Using radioactive scorpion
venom sounds like science fiction ” but it is actually
science fact! Medical trials are so promising
that doctors now want to see if the protein works
against other tumors  as well

poisoners in the pond
the old swimming hole for many folks it's the spot where they skate in the winter cool off in the summer
and fish most of the year for other critters its the place
to feed and breed and since poisonous and venomous critters can 
be found most anywhere you can bet your
bathing suit that some of these pond dwellers are toxic

frog vs. toad frog toad
hedgehogs love toad venom
hedgehogs are cute critters with non venomous non barbed spines. they defend themselves by rolling
into a prickly ball. these mammals found in europe asia africa and new zealand often self anoint they smear their
spines with various substances from some species one of those substances is toad poison the hedgehog will chew toad skin and then lick
its spines to coat them with saliva poison mixture it may use the poison in self defense for getting rid of 
parasites for attracting a mate or for all those and other reasons parotid glands

Toad tadpoles  Some insects will eat them 
but many other animals won't  Why? Because
they're poisonous 
Toads  example: Bufo americanus  are amphibians 
cold blooded animals with backbones that
are generally born in moist places  They live in
forests and deserts  as well as in and near freshwater
ponds and streams  As tadpoles  or larvae 
amphibians need gills to breathe  and then they
develop into adults with lungs and legs  Some
species spend their entire lives in water  Others 
such as many types of toads  are more terrestrial 
But they still
need to lay their
eggs in ponds
and other damp
areas 



What is the difference between a frog and a
toad? Technically  toads are frogs  and it is often
hard to distinguish one from another  But while
true frogs  members of the Ranidae family  have
smooth  moist skin and long hind legs with webbed
feet  true toads  members of the Bufonidae family 
have dry  bumpy skin and short hind legs  And
unlike their North American frog cousins  North
American toads are poisonous at all stages of their
life cycle: egg  tadpole  and adult 
Toad poison is a fluid produced from large
parotid glands behind the animal's eyes and from
glands on its back  The fluid tastes terrible and will
burn a predator's mouth  eyes  and skin  Depending
on the species  the toad's poison ranges from irritating
to deadly  Some species  such as the fire bellied
toads  Bombina 
of Europe and
Asia  are aposematic 
advertising
their toxins
by arching their
backs and raising
both their front and hind legs to display their
red  or yellow and black bellies 
All toads are hunters  They eat fish  worms 
slugs  spiders  birds  mice  and especially insects 
which makes them welcome to gardeners and
farmers  But one toad has become more of a
nuisance than a friend and humans have only
themselves to blame for the problem  It's the cane
or marine toad  Bufo marinus  
this cane is a pain  cane toad snakes in the grass pond hognose snake cottonmouth snake 


Indigenous to Central and South America 
the cane toad lives mainly on land  but it breeds
in fresh water  It can spray  as well as ooze  its
heart stopping poison  In its native habitats 
the cane toad population has been kept in check
by predators  which include fish  caimans  and
snakes  But in Australia  this amphibian has
become a serious pest 
Up until 1935  Australia had no toads at all 
Some people thought it would be a good idea to
bring in a species that would eat sugar cane pests:
greyback and French's cane beetles  Dermolepida
albohirtum and Lepidiota frenchi   They selected
the cane toad  which had been introduced in
Hawaii and was doing well in that climate 
Unfortunately  the toads failed to eat the beetles 
Instead  they bred and bred and bred some
more and began to eat other critters  including
Australia's native frogs 
But few critters could eat the cane toads and
survive  Fish that ate their tadpoles died  Other
animals  including crocodiles and pet dogs  that
dined on the adult toads died  too  The northern
quoll  Dasyurus hallucatus   a carnivorous marsupial 
has now become severely endangered  not
only because of habitat loss  but also because of
cane toad poisoning  A recent study says that
several snakes are evolving defenses against the
toads  They are developing smaller heads and
longer bodies  which means that they can't swallow
the cane toads they can take only smaller
and safer prey 
Other Australian predators  such as a few
varieties of turtles and snakes  can tolerate the
toad's toxins  Some species of birds and rats  have
adapted to eat only the toad's nontoxic tongue or
have learned to flip the toad  attack its belly  and
devour its internal organs 
Unfortunately  there aren't enough predators
to eat enough of the toads  And the diseases and
parasites that control the toad population in other
countries aren't found in Australia  Then there's
the stunning fact that each pair of toads can produce
as many as thirty five thousand eggs twice
a year  That's a lot of toads and a lot of toad
toxin  Australia is currently spending millions
of dollars to find biological controls to deal with
the species  Environmentalists have even recently
asked the country's military to wage war on them
in an effort to stop their spread 



Some snakes  such as hognose  Heterodon  and water snakes
 Nerodia   are immune to toad poison and can eat adult toads 
Hognose snakes are mildly venomous
to people  Water snakes
are not known to be venomous 
but people sometimes confuse
them with a snake that is 
the cottonmouth  Agkistrodon
piscivorus   also known as the
water moccasin 
The cottonmouth is the only venomous aquatic snake in
America  It is rarely found far from a water source a pond 
a lake  a slow moving stream  a swamp  or an estuary  an area
where freshwater and seawater mix   Although this snake has a
bad reputation  it is not aggressive  When it's threatened  it will
try to escape or it will "gape ” opening its mouth wide to show
the white lining  which is how it got its name  If the enemy does
not back off  it may bite with its long fangs to inject powerful
hemotoxic venom 
However  it mostly uses this venom to kill prey such as
fish  frogs  and mice  and the toxins are rarely strong enough
to be fatal to humans  A cottonmouth will never feast on
toads  That dinner might very well be its last 

beware of toe biters
the cottonmouth might not munch on toads  but backswimmers notonecta glauca and 
giant water bugs lethocerus americanus feed on a variety of water creatures including tadpoles
backswimmers paddle upside down on the surface of ponds water bugs lie in wait underwater clinging to 
plants or sticks using a snorkel
like tube at the tip of their abdomen to get oxygen when they sport prey 
both speies use their sharp rostrums to inject venom into a victim and suck out its juices giant
water bugs are known as toe biters because if you dangle 
your feet into their territory they can give you a painful bite
backswimmers and water bugs have wings and you may be more likely to encounter the latter when 
they're flying around outdoors especially near electric lights
on their way to find a new pond or stream in which to mate

stopping by the  woods on a toxic evening

whose woods these are i think i know
toxic critters there below with their
coolness moisture ample food supply and many
places to hide termperate woodlands and forests
are ideal habitats for many animals
some such as deer and game birds are hunted for food 
others such as many amphibians are found on no one's menu

and for a good reason they're pure poison 

never swallow a salamander



Some of those amphibians are toads  Others
are newts and salamanders  Actually  a newt is
a salamander but a salamander isn't always
a newt  Salamanders are found in a variety of
habitats  They may be entirely aquatic  or they
may be terrestrial though  in that case  they still
generally need moisture in which to lay eggs  or
the eggs themselves have to be moist inside for
the larvae to spend their aquatic stage in them 
Some salamanders lay eggs on dry land  but then
the eggs don't hatch until spring rains submerge
them  Newts always breed in water  but they
spend the rest of the year on land  so they're
called semi aquatic 
Like toads and certain
frogs  newts and
salamanders secrete poison
through their scaleless
skin  In addition 
as a defense  some newts have sharp ribs that poke
through their back  The ribs can jab a predator's
mouth and also deliver more of the toxin 
Salamander and newt poison ranges from
mild to lethal  The American rough skin newt
 Taricha granulosa  is one of the most toxic animals
known to science  It produces tetrodotoxin 



a deadly neurotoxin that blocks signals from
the brain that tell an animal's lungs how to
breathe and its heart how to beat  Although
this poison is the newt's defense against shore
birds  bullfrogs  fish  and other predators  it has
also been known to hurt and even kill people 
In one case  a scientist had a wound on his
finger  He handled a newt  and the toxin entered
the cut  He suffered from nausea  dizziness  and
a totally numb arm for half an hour  In another
far worse incident  a man swallowed a rough skinned
newt on a dare  Within ten minutes  his lips
began to tingle  During the next two hours  he
became weak and numb  and then  despite hospital
treatment  his heart stopped and he died 
It's best not to handle this amphibian and  for
goodness sake  don't ever swallow one!
Many newts and salamanders are aposematic 
Some  like young red spotted newts  Notophthalmus
viridescens   which are called red efts  walk boldly
through the eastern American woods  displaying
their brilliant red orange skin to warn predators
of their poison  Others  such as the western red bellied
newt  Taricha rivularis   curve their heads
and legs over their backs to display their scarlet
undersides when they're threatened much as
red bellied toads do 
European fire salamanders  Salamandra salamandra 
not only have poisonous black and yellow
skin  but they also can spray toxins from
glands on their backs  These amphibians can tilt
their bodies in an enemy's direction and spray
farther than six feet 
Some predators can see these warning colors 
but others can't  so newts and salamanders
also wave their heads or tails and make sounds
to warn enemies  One woodland critter that has
learned to recognize these movements and noises
and so avoid noshing on newts is the short tailed
shrew  Blarina brevicauda   the only venomous
mammal in North America and one of the few
venomous mammals in the world

Shrews are tiny  solitary  mostly nocturnal
animals found in temperate forests throughout
most of the world  Fierce predators  they eat
many kinds of animals  including insects  earthworms 
spiders  birds  amphibians  and rodents
 which are sometimes larger than the shrew
itself   as well as vegetation  nuts  and fruits 
When a shrew bites its prey  toxic saliva flows
through grooves in its lower front teeth to kill or
paralyze the victim  Shrews use a lot of energy  so
they must eat constantly  They store piles of live 
paralyzed prey in their burrows so they'll always
have plenty of fresh food on hand 
Although a shrew is immune to its own
venom  it probably is not immune to the venom
of fellow shrews  These little carnivores are known
for feuding over territory  So if a shrew gets bitten
by another shrew during a turf war  it may become
paralyzed or die 
If you were to get chomped by a shrew 
you'd experience pain and swelling  but you'd be
unlikely to expire  In fact  shrew venom may be
used in the future to help treat migraines  high
blood pressure  and neuromuscular diseases  and
even to smooth out wrinkles 
Shrews are eaten by owls  hawks  weasels 
snakes  and salamanders  but other predators
won't touch them  That's not because of their
venom  It's because of their stink  A shrew's scent
glands make it smell and taste mighty bad  So if
your cat leaves a shrew on your doorstep  Felix
may well be telling you

fingers with nails on each hand  opposable
thumbs  they can touch the other fingers   three
kinds of teeth  and a well developed brain 
among other characteristics  The slow loris lives
in rainforests and other woodlands  as well as
in suburban gardens  where it spends its days
sleeping in the trees and its nights searching
for fruit  eggs  insects  and other small prey to
eat  It moves slowly and deliberately hand overhand 
though it can climb quickly if startled 
It's such an adorable critter  with its big eyes
and tiny ears who would guess it's toxic?
Dr  Bryan Fry knows it's toxic  After having been
bitten several times by these animals  he's discovered
that slow lorises secrete toxin from tissues
similar to sweat pores on the inside of their
elbows  The animals take the toxin into their
mouths and deliver it with their saliva when
they bite in self defense  Fry says it appears
that mother lorises also comb this toxin through
their babies' fur  possibly as protection from
predators  There's much to be learned about this
mysterious new mammalian poison  and it suggests
that more toxic animals may be out there
than we could ever have imagined 

more endangered than dangerous
in haiti the dominican republic and cuba solenodons 
solenodon paradoxus and solenodon cubanus are large cousins of
shrews and like them they have venomous saliva and a bad
odor solenodons tend to be nervous and will squeal and bite readily 
but they are much more endangered than dangerous they ahve
been nearly wiped out by introduced species such as dogs cats
and mongooses which were brought to the islands to hunt mice
and rats solenodons may even be extinct in some areas

in the jungle the might jungle the toxic
sleep tonight
in these forests something's always 
singing in the rain
tropical rainforests are warm humid belts of 
green with much rainfall more than eighty inches annually all that
moisture makes for lush trees flowers and fruits food and home 
for more than half of the world's animals some of them live on the
forest floor others live in various levels of the trees
some are well camouflaged others were boldly colored let's visit
some of the flashy inhabitants first and see what they're announcing


pitohui

We're in a New Guinea rainforest 
where agarwood trees grow  birdwing butterflies
glow  and poisonous birds flourish  You don't
believe me? Ask a local resident  and he'll point
out a pretty  red and black creature nicknamed a
“rubbish bird ” Ask a scientist  and he'll tell you
it's a Pitohui dichrous a hooded pitohui    
Whatever the name  one taste and you'd
go too 
The scientist who first documented the poisonous
bird was Jack Dumbacher  In 1989  he caught
a hooded pitohui  and  as he was removing it
from the net  it bit and scratched his hands  He
put a finger in his mouth  and his lips and tongue
went numb  From talking to the locals  he discovered
that the species was toxic 


The hooded and two other pitohui species  as
well as another bird  the blue capped ifrita  Ifrita
kowaldi   are the only known toxic birds so
far  They have cardio  and neurotoxins called
batrachotoxins in their feathers and skin that make
them smell and taste terrible  Recently  Avit
Wako  a New Guinean naturalist  seems to have
discovered the source of the toxins: tiny Melyrid
beetles  example: Choresine pulchra   which the
birds eat  If tasted  both the birds and the beetles
cause people to have burning  tingling sensations
in their mouths 


Toxic Birds
Once upon a time  brightly colored  native parakeets lived
all over the eastern They were called Carolina parakeets
 Conuropsis carolinensis   and they traveled in huge  noisy 
flocks of
sometimes as many as one thousand birds  But by the early twentieth
century  the species went extinct  No one is sure what caused
this sad event  Theories include loss of habitat  over hunting  and
disease  or a combination of all of these  Some experts feel that
disease was the primary factor  and it revolved around the birds'
favorite food  cockleburs 
The cocklebur is a weed that grows in cleared areas around
homes and farms  It is toxic to domestic animals  but the parakeets
were able to eat the plant with no ill effects  People appreciated
the birds' diet because it reduced the weeds and protected their
livestock  Several naturalists described how the toxins protected the
parakeets  too  by killing animals that tried to eat them 
But as settlements spread  so did cockleburs  When the birds
visited the communities to feed on the plants  they were exposed
to more and more diseases that are carried by livestock  Because the
birds weren't immune to these diseases  they died 
America may indeed have had its own species of toxic birds  It
is unfortunate that none of us will ever get to see one

blue capped ifrita
hooded pitohui
america's own toxic birds 
melyrid beetle


Melyrid beetles are also found across the
globe in Central and South American rainforests 
There  they are the diet of poison dart frogs and
they're the reason some varieties of these little 
jewel colored amphibians  as well as the pitohui
and ifrita  are poisonous  If the frogs are removed
from their habitat and are fed nontoxic insects 
their toxicity lessens  Frogs born and raised in
captivity and fed on nonpoisonous bugs never
become poisonous at all 
In the wild  poison dart frogs are much more
toxic than poisonous birds  In fact  the golden
poison dart frog  Phyllobates terribilis  is one of the
most poisonous animals in the world  This tiny
amphibian has enough batrachotoxin in its skin
to kill twenty thousand mice or at least eight
human beings if they were to eat the toxin or
absorb enough of it through a wound  A lethal
dose of this poison for a 150 pound person is
136 micrograms the equivalent of two or three
grains of salt! But according to medical studies 
poison dart frog toxins may also turn out to be
useful as antibiotics and painkillers  substances
that cure rather than kill 
All poison dart frogs are aposematic  so most
predators know to avoid them  But the Choco
people  South American natives of Columbian
rainforests  have learned to catch the frogs and
collect their venom  They rub it
on the darts they use to hunt birds 
monkeys  and other animals 
which is how the frogs got their
familiar name  The poison kills the
prey  but doesn't hurt the hunters
who eat the meat 

you wouldn't want this frog in your throat
poison dart frog
green poison dart frog
blue poison dart frog
golden eyelash viper 
anaconda
emerald tree boa
slithering in the trees
on the rainforest floor the golden poison dart frog and its relatives
use their colors to announce that they're toxic is this costa rican golden
eyelash viper bothriechis schlegelii doing the same
Nope  Would you believe that its daring color
is actually camouflage? This nocturnal  venomous
snake named for the scales above its eyes rests
in trees among flowers  fruit  and leaves  hiding
from predators  A type of pit viper  the eyelash
viper is plentiful in banana groves  where it blends
in perfectly  Throughout its range in Central and
South America  the snake shows a wide variety of
colors  all designed to merge with its surroundings 
Many species of snakes are found in rainforests 
The best known ones are the non venomous
boas and anacondas  Eunectes murinus  
But along with the eyelash viper  there are many
venomous varieties  Some  such as the rear fanged
vine snakes  are arboreal they live up in
the trees and eat lizards  small mammals  and
baby birds  They must wrap around their prey and
chew for several seconds or even minutes to inject
their venom  Most are not dangerous to people


Other snakes  such as the Central and South
American fer de lance and the bushmaster
 Lachesis muta   are terrestrial  living under leaves
or in logs on the ground  Like the eyelash viper
 and the American cottonmouth and the copperhead  
both the fer de lance and the bushmaster
are pit vipers  These nocturnal snakes
have long fangs and potent hemotoxic venom 
The fer de lance feeds on rodents  lizards  and
frogs and is probably responsible for more human
deaths in South America than any other snake 
The bushmaster  which can grow to twelve feet 
making it the longest venomous snake in the
Americas  is one of the few
snakes to eat only mammals 
While the fer de lance can
live around farms and homes 
the bushmaster is found only
in undisturbed rainforests  so
people are much less likely to
encounter it 
The Gaboon viper  Bitis gabonica  of African
forests  coastal dunes  and other areas is the heaviest
of all vipers  and it produces the most venom 
It's also in the record books as the snake with the
longest fangs up to two inches in length  Its
colors camouflage it among the leaf litter  where
it lies waiting to catch large rodents  ground
birds  and other prey  Like some of its relatives 
this viper can inflate its body and then deflate it
with a hissing sound to threaten predators 



Most coral snakes are found in tropical forests 
but the American species  the only terrestrial fixed fang
snakes in the     also live in woodlands and
in dry  desert like areas  They have strong neurotoxic
venom  but they are not aggressive and their
fangs are small  so bites are rare  However  because
they're so pretty  kids sometimes pick them up and
get bitten 
Coral snakes  example: Micrurus fulvius  have
several harmless mimics  such as the scarlet king
snake  Lampropeltis triangulum   The way to tell
them apart inspired this rhyme:"Red touching yellow
kills a fellow Red touching black is a friend of
Jack ” It refers to the bands of color on the snakes 
Have a look  Can you tell which is venomous?
This rhyme actually applies mainly to the
North American species  Many of the tropical
coral snakes with red touching black are NOT
friends of Jack  They're venomous  So  whatever
bands of color are touching  don't you touch any
of these snakes!


 Snakes are not the only fanged creatures in rainforests  Spiders
lurk there  too  including some varieties of tarantulas  funnel webs 
and one of the most venomous spiders in the world: the Brazilian
wandering spider   Phoneutria    This dangerous arachnid can inflict
a very painful  neurotoxic bite  It gets its name from the fact that it
travels forest floors to catch prey instead of building a web 
But this spider journeys in more ways than one  It has been
known to hide in fruit and to hitch rides to countries far from
home  In 2005  a chef in Bridgwater  England  was bitten by a
wandering spider that had stowed away in a box of bananas 
Before he passed out  he snapped a photo of the arachnid with
his camera phone and that picture saved his life  Doctors at the
local hospital sent the picture to the Bristol Zoo  where experts
identified the five inch long spider and told them which antivenin
to give the man  It took a week  but the chef did recover

It has webbed feet and a bill like a duck  lives
by Australian rivers  and lays eggs  But it isn't a
bird  Can you name this critter?
That's right it's a platypus  Ornithorhynchus
anatinus   a semi aquatic mammal  Found in a
wide variety of Australian habitats from snowy
highland woods to steamy rainforests  it swims
the rivers and streams looking for food  Its sensitive
bill has receptors to read electrical currents 
which allow the animal to judge its distance from
prey and to distinguish insect larvae  freshwater
shrimp  and crayfish from nonliving objects  A
platypus can stay underwater for ten minutes or
so without surfacing  When it isn't hunting  it
rests in its burrow in the riverbank 
The platypus  along with three species of echidnas
 Zaglossus  spiny anteaters found in Australia
and New Guinea are monotremes  the only egg laying
mammals on Earth  Echidnas are not venomous 
But the male platypus is  Unlike shrews 
his toxins aren't in his saliva  They're in his thighs 
The venom glands in a male platypus's legs
are connected to hollow spurs on his hind feet 
To inject venom  the platypus kicks its legs and
jabs the spurs  Some scientists think that these
spurs are used both in self defense and in fighting
off other males when the platypuses are looking
for mates  The venom can cause pain and swelling
in people  so it's not a good idea to try to
break up a platypus fight  Let those platypuses
work things out for themselves


Platypuses may be the least familiar creatures
found in rivers  What are the most familiar? Fish 
Rivers are home to many kinds of fish: sharptoothed
carnivores  such as red bellied piranhas
 Pygocentrus nattereri  in the Amazon  vegetarian
grass carp  Ctenopharyngodon idella  in the Amur 
and other more common species  such as catfish 
in the Mississippi 
With their smooth skin and barbels whiskers 
these"cats” may look harmless  But as any
catfish fisherman can tell you  they have weapons
to protect themselves: sharp spines in the fins on
both their back and sides  In some catfish species 
these spines are venomous 
The madtom  Noturus  found in some rivers
in the    can give you a nasty bee like sting 
The smallest species  the tadpole madtom  Noturus
gyrinus  has the most painful sting of all  But  like
most catfish  it will zap you only when trapped or
handled  Its Asian riverine cousin  the Indian catfish
 Heteropneustes fossilis   will attack any enemy
that enters its territory and its sting also hurts 
The brightly striped marine catfish  Plotosus lineatus  
found in oceans and estuaries  is equally toxic 
Catfish and the majority of other animals 
are most venomous when they are fully grown 
However  scats  Scatophagus argus   which are found
in estuaries  harbors  and the lower parts of rivers 
are most venomous when they are babies  The
youngsters can give mild stings with their spines 
Youngsters are easy
prey for many predators 
so being a toxic
baby makes sense 
Eggs are also prey  So
some animals lay eggs
that are poisonous  Just
ask a North American
gar  example: Atractosteus spatula   The adult fish 
however  is not venomous at all  It doesn't need to
be  Its armor like scales and sharp teeth are plenty
of protection against almost any enemy 
Ichthyologists  fish scientists  used to think
there were only about two hundred species of
venomous fish  Now Dr  William Leo Smith and
Ward  Wheeler of the American Museum of
National History believe that there may be more
than a thousand  However  most of them do not
live in freshwater  They're found in oceans and
seas  especially in the Indo Pacific  A few species
have been in American waters for a long time 
but a few others have recently arrived  Let's take
a swim and meet some of them

venomous sea
wading in the ocean is it a treat for your feet or a threat to get them wet
the  answer might be both
venomous fishes often lie in the shallow water near 
the shore
waiting to catch a meal
they are often well camouflaged to surprise 
prey but they sometimes succeed in surprising 
unsuspecting waders as well
many stings occur when people accidentally step on these creatures
that's certainly the case with stingrays

you don't want to catch these rays
stingray
blue spotted stingray
reef stonefish
the deadliest rock in the world



Relatives of sharks  rays are flat bodied fish
that have cartilage dense connective tissue 
instead of bones  They swim with a flying motion
of their large  wing like pectoral fins  Not all rays
are stingrays  but all stingrays have stingers 
The stinger is a long  jagged spine  It can
be clipped off  like a fingernail  and it will grow
back  It has two grooves filled with venom producing
tissue  and it is surrounded by a sheath
that may also produce venom  Stingray venom
is neurotoxic  and anyone who is "stung” should
seek medical attention 
Stingrays are common in coastal waters
throughout the world  There are some freshwater
species  such as the mottled stingray  Potamotrygon
hystrix  of the Amazon  but most are
ocean dwellers  including the southern stingray
 Dasyatis americana  of the Caribbean 
Some rays are benthic they spend most of
their time resting in the shallows  feeding on
worms  clams  shrimp  crabs  snails  and occasionally
fish  Benthic rays have spines at the ends
of their long "tails ” Others are pelagic open
water swimmers  The barbs of pelagic rays are
close to their bodies  probably to protect their
organs in case they are bitten as they swim 



Rays are generally peaceful animals  They
will use their spines only if they are stepped on
or otherwise threatened and then they can lash
out forcefully to protect themselves  A large ray
can exert enough power to drive its barb into a
wooden boat  Most injuries occur when a person
steps directly on a ray  so waders are advised to
shuffle not stomp their feet in waters where
benthic stingrays lurk  That will usually make
the rays swim out of the way 
At the Great Barrier Reef  Steve Irwin  the
Australian naturalist nicknamed the "Crocodile
Hunter ” was killed by a bull ray's  Dasyatis
brevicaudata  stinger but not by its venom  The
ray's barb pierced his heart  and he died almost
instantly after pulling it out  A stingray's sting is
painful  but it is rarely fatal  The strange thing
is  according to The Australian News  Irwin was
apparently searching for another creature that is
deadly the reef stonefish 



The reef stonefish  Synanceia verrucosa  is a
benthic fish that lives on reefs  often under rocks
or ledges  in sandy shallows  and in mud flats 
Squat  lumpy  and usually dark colored though
sometimes splashed with pink or red the fish lies
there  looking like a rock or a piece of coral  With
this camouflage  it can fool prey  When small fishes
and shrimp unknowingly swim by  the stonefish
opens its mouth and  in a flash  swallows them 
Enemies may be fooled  too  But if they get too
close  the stonefish erects its toxic defense: thirteen
venomous spines along its back  These spines can
pierce right through the bottom of sneakers and
flippers  Each spine has enough venom to kill
one thousand mice and it can be fatal to people 
Pressing on the spines releases the toxins  which
cause excruciating pain  swelling  tissue destruction 
muscle weakness  paralysis  shock  and sometimes
death by heart failure  There is now an antivenin
to treat these severe stings 


saltwater snakes
yellow bellied sea snake
banded sea kraits
what isn't this fish called
turkeyfish
lionfish
dragonfish
zebrafish
butterfly cod
firefish
pajamafish
The stonefish has few natural enemies  The
rumor that sea snakes  which live in the same
oceans  eat these creatures is not true  Some sea
snakes specialize in certain prey  such as fish eggs
or eels  others eat a wide variety of fish  Most
species are venomous 
Descendants of Australian land snakes  sea
snakes are well adapted for marine life  They have
flattened tails to help them swim  They can seal
their mouths and nostrils to keep out water  Like
all snakes  they have lungs  but sea snakes can also
absorb oxygen directly from seawater through
their skin  This is called cutaneous respiration 
and it enables a sea snake to stay underwater for
several hours before having to surface and breathe 
Many of these species can be found in shallow
water  but the highly venomous yellow bellied
sea snake  Pelamis platurus  is pelagic 
Another myth about sea snakes is that they
have tiny fangs and can only penetrate the thin 
tender skin between our fingers  The truth is that
even though sea snakes have fixed fangs  these
teeth are not especially tiny  and they can puncture
human skin in many places on our bodies 
However  sea snakes are
not usually inclined to
bite people and when
they do bite  they often
do not deliver venom 
That's a good thing
because their neuro and
myotoxic  affecting
skeletal muscles  venom
is quite potent 
An antivenin is available  and it can be used
against all sea snake envenomations  as well as
that of sea kraits  Laticauda   which are also
marine snakes  It's made from the venom of the
beaked sea snake  Enhydrina schistosa   which is
responsible for more than half of sea snake bites
and ninety percent of fatalities caused by sea
snakes  It isn't particularly aggressive  but it lives
in shallow estuaries and more frequently comes
into contact with people who fish and wade in
these places  particularly in Southeast Asia 
It is unusual for a single species' antivenin to
be effective against the bites of other species  The
beaked sea snake's venom is a simple one  unlike
the complex mixtures of toxins that make up land
snakes' venoms  Dr  Bryan Fry believes that the
simplicity of the venom comes from the simplicity
of sea snakes' lives and diet: They eat fish and
other small marine creatures  while land snakes
eat a much wider variety of animals and live in
more diverse habitats 


Believe it or not  it goes by every name
except  The gorgeous lionfish  Pterois   as it
is most commonly called  is the cousin of the
unattractive stonefish  Both are members of the
venomous scorpionfish family  Like its camouflaged
relatives  the aposematic maroon striped
lionfish has venomous spines in its fins  which it
uses in self defense  When it feels threatened  the
fish opens its mouth wide and flares these fins 
Males may also possibly use their spines to battle
other males during mating season 
The lionfish is native to the Indo Pacific area 
where it is found swimming around reefs  often
in shallow areas  and sometimes in bays  estuaries 
and harbors  So  unless you take a trip to that area 
you're not likely to encounter a lionfish  right?
Not necessarily      
Lionfish are now found in the Atlantic Ocean
from Florida to New York and they are thriving 
although mainly at depths of one hundred twenty
feet or more  where the Gulf Stream warms the
waters  How did they get there? The answer lies
in the lionfish's looks  With their flashy stripes 
lionfish have become popular aquarium fish in the
   In 1992  when Hurricane Andrew destroyed
a Florida aquarium  six lionfish were accidentally
released into Biscayne Bay  At other times  captive
lionfish were probably set free on purpose by
home aquarium owners who didn't want to deal
with toxic critters that grow large and eat the other
fish in the tank  This practice of releasing animals
in non native areas is not only bad for the environment 
but it's also against the law 
As lionfish thrive in the Atlantic  more people 
such as divers and fishermen  are likely to
encounter them and therefore  to get stung  A
lionfish's stab is usually not fatal  but it will cause
severe pain and swelling  sometimes for days or
weeks even if the fish was not alive when the
victim was stung  Dr  William Leo Smith found
that out when he was a college student working
in a pet shop that sold these fish  As he reached
into a garbage pail into which a telephone had
fallen  Smith got zapped by a dead lionfish that
someone had thrown away 
Other venomous fish are also dangerous
when deceased because the venom remains in the
spines and is released by pressure  And sometimes
the spines break and remain in a person's
skin  causing infection  All in all  a goldfish or a
guppy makes a much safer pet than a member of
the scorpionfish clan 

don't tread on me 
many other toxic fishes are found in shallow waters
these benthic creatures are generally
light brown or dark brown or 
speckled to blend with the mud sand rocks or coral
where they lie hidden
all have venomous spines on their backs or near
their gills or both here are just a few
varieties

do fish like venomous worms
bloodworm
ribbon worm
fireworm


Toadfish  Batrachoididae 
There are forty five species of toadfish  but not all are toxic 
The venomous varieties are found in coastal Central and South
America  Their toxins cause pain  swelling  dizziness  and fever 
as well as wounds that take a long time to heal  One species  the
niquim  Thalassophryne nattereri   is responsible for injuring many
Brazilian fishermen yearly when they step on it or accidentally get
jabbed by its spines as they try to remove it from a fishing net 
Why is it called a "toadfish”? Well  with its squat body and
big mouth  it looks somewhat like a toad and when it croaks or grunts  
it sounds a bit like one  too 
Stargazer  Uranoscopus 
Found in coastal areas all around the world  this fish gets
its name from you guessed it its eyes  which sit on top of its
head  looking upward  Some species have a worm shaped lure in
their mouths  They wiggle it to attract their prey's attention  and
then leap up to grab the victim  In addition to having venomous
spines behind its gills  the stargazer can also deliver an electric
shock to any enemy that dares to seize it 
Weever  Trachinus 
Weevers are found in the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean  
When this fish lies buried in
the sand  only the top of its head and the tips of its spines are visible  
Its neurotoxic venom is painful 
though not usually fatal  The treatment for its toxins  and
that of many of the other venomous fishes  is soaking the
affected limb in very hot water for thirty to ninety minutes
and then repeating as often as necessary  The heat breaks
down the protein in the venom 



Some do  Striped bass  king mackerel  whiting  and many other
species love bloodworms  Glycera dibranchiata  
Bloodworms live in sandy  silty  or muddy shores  They are polychaetes 
segmented marine worms with bristles called setae  Each
worm can be more than a foot long  with a three inch proboscis that
is eversible it can be turned inside out  The proboscis is tipped with
four hard  venomous fangs for hunting and self defense 
Most animals' teeth contain the mineral calcium  Scientists have
recently discovered that bloodworm fangs are made of a combination
of protein and copper  The bloodworm is the only species known to
make its own copper teeth! Its bite can hurt for days  so wormers looking
for bait have to be careful digging for and handling these critters 
Most nemertines  or ribbon worms  example: Amphiporus bimaculatus  
are benthic animals that live in shallow seas or coastal waters 
They get their name from their great length  They are among the longest
creatures in the sea  They're also called proboscis worms because
they have an eversible proboscis they use to capture prey 
In some species the proboscis is equipped with a single thin stylet
that injects neurotoxic venom  The stylet is usually released by
the worm  or it breaks off upon striking the prey  When the worm
withdraws its proboscis  it loads another stylet  A ribbon worm may
have six stylets in reserve at any one time  Harmless to people  these
worms hunt for small invertebrates  animals without backbones  
such as other worms 
Another group of polychaetes  the fireworms  also called bristleworms  
live on reefs  beneath stones  and in sea grass or mud
 example: Hermodice carunculata   On their sides they have venomous
setae that penetrate fish  then break off  releasing irritating
venom  The venom doesn't kill the fish  but it may teach them to
leave these worms alone  Any person pierced by a fireworm's setae
will probably learn the same thing

a meal to remember if you live that long 
puffer fish
and now for something completely different
fugu
blenny
Sharks and big teeth go
together  But sharks and
venom? Yep  Just ask a spiny
dogfish  Squalus acanthias  
A small shark that hunts
in packs like canines  the
spiny dogfish is something
a fisherman doesn't care to
snare  If this critter is caught
in a fishing line  it will curl
into a bow and strike with its two sharp spines 
Each spine has a groove with a gland inside to
make and pump venom  The bad news is that any
fisherman pierced by these spines will be in pain
for hours or even days  The good news is that he
or she will survive 
There are several other venomous sharks 
Some  like the spiny dogfish  can live in shallow
or deep water to depths of
six hundred feet  A relative of
the shark called the chimaera
 example: Chimaera monstrosa 
is almost never found above six
hundred feet 
In Greek mythology  the
chimaera is a monster with a
lion's head  a goat's body  and a
serpent's tail  The fishes of that
name look monstrous and rather stitched together 
too  Big headed and big eyed with a long  rat like
tail  the chimaera feeds on small animals that live
near the bottom of the ocean  Unlike a shark  it
has four large plates in its mouth instead of teeth 
Because it dwells so deep in the water  few people
have ever seen one and fewer have probably been
stabbed by its single spine 


Some people have reported that chimaeras and many
sharks are toxic to eat  However  the most dangerous food
fish isn't a shark or a chimaera  It's the puffer  or blowfish  
This fish gets its name from its ability to inflate itself so that
it is too large for an enemy to swallow  Some species are
prickly  as well  Not every species of puffer is poisonous  but
many are  If a predator does manage to eat a toxic puffer  it
will probably die because the fish's skin  blood  and organs
contain tetrodotoxin  and each fish has enough of the stuff
to kill thirty people or a dozen elephants   Though the
elephants are far less likely than humans to eat it! 



And humans do eat it the tasty flesh and fins
of one species  that is  In Japan  people order a
variety of this expensive fish  known as fugu  Fugu
rubides  in restaurants  Only special licensed chefs
are allowed to prepare it  They have to remove
the poisonous bits  and they must be very skilled
because just a tiny amount of the fish's tetrodotoxin 
enough to fit on a pinhead can kill a
person 
But the toxin may soon have a healing use 
too  Scientists are now testing a drug made
from it as a non addictive painkiller for patients
with cancer and other illnesses  In clinical trials 
patients were treated with tiny amounts of the
drug twice a day for four days  After three days 
nearly seventy percent of them felt less pain 
The relief often lasted way beyond the last
injection in some cases more than two weeks 
Each fish can provide six hundred doses of the
drug  so there is currently an ample supply  It
will take more trials  but puffer poison may soon
be a great new medicine on the market 


They're cute  they're brilliantly colored  and
they're toxic  Meet the fanged blennies  the only
fish known to have venomous bites! The poison 
used only in self defense  flows up two fangs in
the fish's lower jaw  The blenny can regulate its
flow  Is this venom dangerous to humans? Not
really  The blenny's bite has been compared to a
wasp sting nasty  but not deadly 
Some blennies have harmless imitators  The
golden mimic blenny  Plagiotremus laudanus flavus 
is a non venomous fish that looks just like
a canary fang blenny  Meiacanthus oualanensis  
Predators avoid it  too 
Where are these unique fish found? Like some
lionfish and stonefish  they live in
the "rainforests of the oceans” 
the coral reefs  And that's where
we're headed next


caution it's a coral reef
a ship is traveling through the darkness
of outer space
the astronauts gazing at the earth below can 
see seas and mountains but only one living thing
it's the vast australian great barrier reef made up of coral
coral reefs are found not only in 
australia but also in warm clear shallow 
oceans waters worldwide they provide
food and shelter for many sea creatures
they protect shorelines
from erosion and they produce lots
and lots of venom
stony stingers and their tenants


Many types of corals live in the world's oceans 
All are cnidarians  Cnidarians
are among the oldest groups of animals  They
have tentacles feelers covered with stinging
darts called nematocysts  When an animal brushes
against these nematocysts  they fire venom into its
skin  Cnidarians use their venom to kill fish for
food and to protect themselves 
Not all corals are reef builders  Only some
species of hard corals  example: Turbinaria 
have that ability  These corals form colonies
that join together to construct organisms such
as the Great Barrier Reef  A reef may look like
bare rock  but it's made up of living animals and
skeletons  Each hard coral on the reef creates a
stony  calcium carbonate outer case and hides
inside it all day  Living corals build their cases
on tops of the cases of dead ones  At night  the
corals come out to feed  waving their tentacles
and firing their nematocysts at tiny sea creatures
that sweep by 
Most corals can't hurt people  But in Florida's
waters and in the Caribbean  a relative of true
corals called fire coral  Millepora  will make your
skin burn if you touch it 



Reefs are rather like apartment houses  and a lot of
their tenants are venomous  Venom is a powerful weapon
for protection and hunting when there's so much competition
for food and space  Many types of sea anemones
live on reefs  These strange relatives of coral look like
flowers  but they are animals and they can sting 
Sea anemones can creep or float  but most of the time 
they don't move  They are found in oceans all around the
world  in both deep and shallow water  clinging to rocks 
shells  coral  sand  and shipwrecks 
Each sea anemone is a cnidarian with a thick body
topped by a mouth surrounded by a ring of fleshy  nematocyst 
covered tentacles  Most species have nematocysts
that are too weak to penetrate human skin  but some  such
as the branching anemone  Lebrunia danae  and the fire
anemone  Actinodendron plumosum   can sting people  and
their venom
causes itching 
burning 
swelling  and
severe pain 
The hydra  Hydra  is a
small  freshwater relative
of the sea anemone 
another cnidarian with
stinging tentacles  It eats
tiny critters such as water
fleas and insect larvae
and is no danger to large
animals 
In Greek mythology 
the Hydra was a many headed
monster  If you
cut off one head  two
would grow in its place 
Though our little hydra
friend can reproduce
through the mating of a male and female  it can also do
so by budding  with no male required  just as corals can 
Budded baby hydras just grow right out of their mother's
“sides ” A hydra can have as many as four buds  which turn
into offspring and no beheading is required!
fire coral got its name because if you touch it you will feel a burn
flowers that aren't hydra phobia

plant or animal you decide sundew
water lily
sea anemone pitcher plant
sea urchin
answer the sea anemone and sea urchins are animals
sundews and pitcher plants are carnivorous plants that feed on insects
the water lily is a lovely and non carnivorous flower

A few animals eat sea anemones  Many others
avoid them  But not the anemonefishes  such as
this clownfish  Amphiprion ocellaris  made famous
in the animated film Finding Nemo 
Clownfishes and their relatives live in the
anemones  feeding on algae and plankton  These
fish have a thick coating of mucus that makes
them immune to the anemones' stings  Some
anemonefish have a specific type of anemone
as their partner  Others visit several varieties of
anemones  The fish are protected by the cnidarians 
and  though no one is sure what the
anemones get in return  it is possible that the fish
protect them by chasing away predators 
There are two current theories about how and
where the anemonefish gets its mucus covering 
One is "acclimatization” the fish swims for
hours among the anemone's tentacles  making
brief contact  receiving non lethal stings  and
smearing the mucus from the cnidarian onto its
own body  A second theory states that the mucus
comes from the fish  and it lacks an element that
causes the anemone to fire its nematocysts 
Both theories may be true  For anemonefish
that visit several species of anemones  the acclimatization
theory makes sense  For anemonefish
that have just one host  the mucus theory may be
more relevant 


Another critter that doesn't fear sea anemones is
the hermit crab  Unlike other crabs  hermits don't
have their own shell like coverings  They slip into
the abandoned shells of mollusks soft bodied 
shell making animals such as snails and whelks 
Several types of hermit crabs
gather sea anemones and stick
them to their shells for protection 
The anemones may benefit
by getting leftover scraps
of the crabs' food  A single
crab may wear as many as six
anemones on its shell 
Another species  the boxer crab  Lybia tessellata 
of Australia  holds anemones in each of its
claws and  like boxing gloves  thrusts them at
enemies  It may also use the anemones to stun
prey 



They're round  They're colorful  They're the
pincushions of the sea  They're the sea urchins 
and you'll find them feeding mostly on algae on
reefs  in tide pools  sandy shallows  and rocky
rubble  as well as in deep water on sea beds 
Sea urchins are echinoderms animals known
for radial symmetry  arms or rays arranged in a
pattern around a central body  and tube feet that
move through a pumping action  Most  but not
all  echinoderms have spiny skins  Sea urchins'
spines  used for protection  can be short or long 
depending on the species  They can break off
in your skin and cause infection  Some urchins 
such as the fire urchin  Asthenosoma varium  have
venomous spines  which cause more serious pain
and swelling  and sometimes numbness  irregular
heartbeat  and other symptoms 
Besides their spines  urchins  as well as sea stars 
have pedicellariae tiny pincers on stalks used for
self defense and cleaning  In the flower sea urchin
 Toxopneustes pileolus   these pedicellariae make the
creature appear to be a big blossom  But anyone
who touches these"petals” is in for a nasty surprise 
Within them are venomous jaws that deliver a
painful bite  as well as possible paralysis and respiratory
distress  These pincers can hang on and keep
pumping venom even if they're pulled out of the
urchin's body  so they have to be removed from
a victim as quickly as possible  Heat helps break
down the venom  On the Seychelles Islands in
the Indian Ocean  people bitten by these urchins
sometimes put hot oil or drip candle wax onto the
punctures to stop the pain 



Sea stars are the urchins' cousins  There are
eighteen hundred species of this echinoderm 
but only one is known to be venomous: the
Australian crown of thorns starfish  Acanthaster
planci   Its spines  used for self defense  can cause
painful wounds and even paralyze a person 
But the crown of thorns
is more deadly to coral and
for that it doesn't use its
spines  It uses its stomach 
which it pushes out through
its mouth  Strong acids dissolve the coral polyps 
and small hairs collect the gooey food and carry
it inside the sea star  Adult crown of thorns
sea stars eat only coral  and large numbers of
them can destroy entire reefs  Population explosions
of these echinoderms regularly occur  and
experts have many theories as to what causes the
outbreaks  from natural occurrences to human
impact  The good thing is that through studying
this animal  people are learning a lot about the
ecosystem of the reefs

vegetables that aren't
The reefs are home to many other echinoderms 
Spineless sea cucumbers  example: Holothuria leucospilota  
with their long bodies and tough skin 
look like       cucumbers  Also found in other habitats
such as bedrock  sand  and eelgrass beds  and
in waters both shallow and deep  sea cucumbers
can expel their organs if they're startled by predators 
and then regrow them  Some
sea cucumbers will first produce
sticky threads in self defense  These
contain a neurotoxin called holothurin 
which is deadly to fish and
small mammals 
Believe it or not  sea cucumbers 
including their spewed intestines are eaten in
many Asian countries and elsewhere  They have
to be carefully cleaned  a process that takes days 
They are also prized for medicinal properties  The
flesh and mucus may lower blood pressure  reduce
inflammation  heal wounds  and even slow aging 
Because of the high demand for these delicacies 
sea cucumbers are being over harvested and even
illegally harvested in some parts of the world 
Numerous organizations are currently trying to
address this serious problem

sponges to stay away from
Many types of sponges  Porifera  also live on
the reefs  Poriferans don't have mouths  Instead 
they have tiny pores to draw in water  Cells in
their body walls filter plankton and other food
from the water as it's pumped in and then out of
the sponge's body through larger openings 
Sponges come in all shapes and sizes  Some
look like big holey cheeses or fingers or chimneys 
while others resemble vases  bushes  or flat sheets 
None are venomous they can't bite or sting but
a few  such as the fire and touch me not sponges
 Tedania ignis and Neofibularia nolitangere  are
poisonous if handled  They have toxins that can
cause rashes and swelling 
Fire sponges have red or orange warning colors
to announce that they're toxic  But the most venomous
sea creature in the
world can switch from
warning coloration to
camouflage and back
again with ease  And
it has four times as
many arms as you do!

eight arms to hold you
Found on reefs and in tide pools  caves  holes 
and submerged old bottles and cans  the blue ringed
octopus  Hapalochlaena  of coastal Australia
starts life the size of a pea and grows to the size
of a golf ball  When it is hunting or hiding  its
camouflage colors are light yellow to dark brown 
but when it is threatened  its aposematic colors are
bright yellow with electric blue rings  If this creature
bites you with its parrot like beak  those colors
may be the last ones you'll ever see 
All octopuses probably use toxic saliva to kill
prey such as crabs  but none of them are deadly to
people except for the blue ringed species  It is not
an aggressive animal at all  but it will bite enemies
that provoke it  Because the mollusk  its shell
is inside instead of outside  is so little and cute 
people sometimes pick it up and that's how they
get bitten  Its beak can pierce a diver's wetsuit 
The bite is painless  but the octopus delivers saliva
that contains highly dangerous tetradotoxin 
Within minutes  the victim is paralyzed 
Soon  he or she can no longer breathe  There is
no antivenin  The only way to save the victim is
by giving mouth to mouth resuscitation  rescue
breathing  and heart massage for hours until the
person begins to breathe again on his or her own 
If the victim lives through the first twenty four
hours after being bitten  he or she usually will
recover completely

one tongue to kill you
striated cone shell
the radula of a cone shell
textile cone shell

People have long appreciated the beauty
of mollusks  Some collect their shells  That's
a fine hobby  as long as the animals aren't
endangered species and as long as the collector
doesn't get zapped by a live and deadly
cone shell  also called cone snail  
Many mollusks have a long tongue called
a radula that is covered with small  hard teeth
used for drilling into or rasping away at food  But
the venomous cone shells' teeth are different 
they can inject conotoxin  which paralyzes and
kills prey  Each tooth is a harpoon that sends out
a fine thread to hook a fish  worm  or another
mollusk  Then the cone shell pulls in its catch 
This allows the slow moving mollusk to capture
faster prey  Sometimes the catch is human 
Like other venomous animals  cone shells
aren't interested in humans as food  However  in
self defense a shell will harpoon folks who pick
it up  Those folks are often collectors drawn to
the shell's beautiful colors and its elegant shape 
Like the blue ringed octopus's beak  the cone
shell's harpoon can pierce
a wetsuit or gloves  and 
depending on the species 
its nearly painless sting
can be fatal  There is no


antivenin  and victims may require mouth to mouth
resuscitation and heart massage  There have been about
thirty reported cone shell deaths since 1935 and perhaps
others that were unrecorded 
Among the most dangerous species found on reefs 
sand  and rubble in the warm  shallow waters of the Indo 
Pacific are the striated cone  Conus striatus   the tulip
cone  Conus tulipa   the textile cone  Conus textile   and
the geographic cone  Conus geographus   These mollusks
produce different toxins at different times  probably to
suit different prey  A cone shell might never use the exact
same combination of toxins twice! Scientists are studying
these toxins for medical uses  especially as non addictive
painkillers  One is already on the market 
Besides their potential for medical use  cone shells also
provide food for people in places such as the Philippines
and Samoa  The venom isn't toxic when eaten  How do
hunters gather these shells? VERY CAREFULLY!
Cone shells' colors are good camouflage against rocks 
coral  and sand  They blend in well  making them hard
for their victims to spot  Another group of venomous sea
creatures is also hard to see because they're see through 
But you can see them on the next page

medusas
polyps
corals are not the only cnidarians this large group also includes sea
anemones jellyfish hydras portuguese man of wars and other creatures
their bodies are basically a sac with a single opening for feeding and waste

to rock plants and other bases and hardly move medusas are round and free

oceans are salty bodies of water that cover more than 
seventy percent of our planet
they've divided into numerous zones from the photic where sunlight 
can reach to the trenches the deepest of which is nearly thirty six 
thousand feet
people have been sailing these waters for many millennia but jellyfish
have been traveling them for millions of years 
a toast to jellies
Most of these blobs cannot kill people  however 
a few are lethal  We call them all jellyfish 
but they aren't fish at all  They're cnidarians 
Remember that these animals can be polyps or
medusas  Well  most jellyfish are both 
They start life as small larvae called planula 
Then they attach themselves to a surface and
become polyps  These divide and bud into ephyra 
free swimming youngsters that change into
little medusas  The medusas grow into the full sized
adults we see in oceans and aquariums 
Found at all ocean depths  and some even in
freshwater   jellyfish are about ninety five percent
water  They have no backbones  brains  noses  or
ears  but they can detect light and odors through
their nervous system  They swim by pumping
their umbrella like bells  also called floats  This
pumping action lets jellyfish move vertically  But
to move any great distance horizontally  they must
rely on ocean currents  tides  and winds 


Underneath their bells are leaf like "arms”
to bring food to their mouths and thread like
tentacles covered with nematocysts  which fire
neurotoxic venom into prey or predators that
brush against them  A single tentacle can have
hundreds or thousands of nematocysts that fire in
micro seconds even if the tentacle breaks off or
the jellyfish is dead  So when folks tell you not to
touch a jellyfish on the sand  they're not kidding!



The Portuguese man of war  Physalia physalis  
also called a "bluebottle ” is not a jellyfish 
Related to the tiny hydra  it is actually a group
of different types of polyps attached together
beneath an air filled float  It is carried along on
the water's surface by the waves and ocean currents 
The Portuguese man of war's tentacles can
extend sixty five feet below its purple blue float

jellyfish no problem

Most fish avoid jellyfish  But some  such as
the whiting  Merlangius merlangus  and the man of 
war fish  Nomeus gronovii  do just the opposite 
The whiting's host is the enormous lion's mane
jellyfish  which can be as wide as eight feet with
tentacles up to one hundred twenty feet long 
When a whiting is
threatened  it hides
under the jellyfish for
protection  The man of

tentacles  which then

venom  It may
have a special coating on its body that keeps the
nematocysts from stinging 
Other animals  such as the leatherback turtle
 Dermochelys coriacea   can also eat jellyfish tentacles
without getting poisoned  Unfortunately  turtles
are harmed by eating plastic bags that they mistake
for jellyfish one good reason for people to
recycle these items  to prevent illegal dumping of
garbage in the ocean  and to come up with better
ways of managing waste disposal 
Some nudibranches or sea slugs  Glaucus
atlanticus and Glaucilla marginata  can feast on
the Portuguese man of war without triggering
the nematocysts to fire  The darts get stored
inside the nudibranch's body  so when a fish tries
to eat the sea slug  the fish gets stung

jellyfish problem


People and other animals don't have a whiting's
or a nudibranch's protection  A jellyfish or
Portuguese man of war's nematocysts can sting
us through thin clothes or rubber gloves  Most
stings can cause blisters  a rash  and pain  The
lion's mane has a sting that can kill  It is featured
as the innocent murderer in a famous Sherlock
Holmes story "The Adventure of the Lion's
Mane”  This jellyfish's size and the strength of its
venom are what make it dangerous 
The sea nettle  Chrysaora  is another large
jellyfish that packs a nasty  though not usually
deadly  sting  Some species  such as the black
sea nettle  Chrysaora achlyos   can be more than
three feet wide with twenty five foot long tentacles 
In 1989  huge numbers of black sea nettles
appeared off the coast of San Diego  California 
They mysteriously vanished  Then  ten years later 
they bloomed reappeared in record numbers 
Scientists think the reappearance may be due
to more food for these cnidarians caused by
increased nutrients from agricultural run off and
other human activity 
But size doesn't always matter  The box jellyfish
family  which includes the sea wasps and
the Irukandji jellyfish of the Indo Pacific  are
smaller than the lion's mane  but they are the most
deadly cnidarians of all  Unlike other jellyfish  the
peanut sized Irukandji with four three foot long
tentacles  produces a sting that feels mild at first 
But after about thirty minutes or so  it causes
a severe reaction called "Irukandji syndrome ”
a condition of severe muscle spasms  a burning
sensation  and back and kidney pain that can last
for hours or days

Sea wasps can reach the size of a basketball
with tentacles more than ten feet long  Their
venom can be fatal to people in as few as three
minutes  causing heart or respiratory failure  In
fact  one species  Chironex fleckeri  has been called
the most venomous marine animal in the world 
It has caused many injuries and more than sixty
recorded deaths  So far  there is no antivenin 
In Australia  swimmers once commonly used
pantyhose to avoid being stung by these dangerous
critters  A sea wasp's nematocysts are short 
They can't pierce two layers of nylon  Now special
stinger suits made of  are available 
But they don't protect a swimmer or diver's face 
hands  or feet  Recently  a team of marine biologists
developed a sunscreen with a repellent that
fools the jellyfish into thinking the person is neither
predator nor prey  They tested it on themselves
and didn't get stung once  It could certainly be a
promising product for folks who like to swim in
dangerous waters

if you get stung by a jellyfish or its cousin
Don't panic! Thrashing around will only make it fire
more nematocysts  If you're in the water  call for a lifeguard 
Get medical help as soon as you can  Ask someone
to help you carefully scrape off any clinging tentacles by
first applying shaving cream or a paste of baking soda or
mud and then shaving the area with a razor  a credit card 
a key  or something else with an edge 
As far as home remedies go  here are the ones that
work: white vinegar  meat tenderizer  baking soda  or salt
water applied to your skin  Ones that don't work include:
ice  fresh water  ammonia  alcohol  or urine  Those liquids
will cause more nematocysts to fire  and the last one might
embarrass you  too  

conclusion let's hear it for the toxic tarantula chironex fleckeri
One summer day in 2006  I went to the
American Museum of Natural History's exhibit 
“Lizards and Snakes: Alive!” I got to see a black
mamba  a Gaboon viper  a red spitting cobra  a
Gila monster  and other reptiles up close  The
exhibit was entertaining and educational and
so were the people attending it  Some were fascinated 
Others had the creeps  Still others were
fascinated and had the creeps 
Whenever we encounter animals that can hurt
us  we have strong reactions  And we should  It
makes sense to be both curious about and wary
of dangerous creatures  whether they are reptiles 
amphibians  insects  spiders  mammals  fish 
birds  cnidarians  or something else 
But it also makes sense to protect these
creatures  Why? For one thing  because they do
so much good  Some pollinate plants so that we
can have fruits  flowers  vegetables and other
crops  Others eat pests that destroy these crops
or vermin that spread diseases  Some venomous
animals themselves are edible  From others  we
get medicines  And think of how many have
inspired poems  stories  paintings  films  and
other works of art!
But venomous and poisonous animals also
deserve our respect simply because they're alive 
and they deserve to stay that way 
Unfortunately  many of these animals are in
danger  They are losing their habitats or are being
sickened by pollutants and waste  They are being
sold as pets or killed by pets  They are slaughtered
by people for their skins  for souvenirs  or
simply for no better reason than because folks just
don't like them 
Unless we learn to appreciate these creatures 
we won't safeguard them and their environments 
If we don't safeguard them  we will never uncover
or understand all the marvels of venom and other
biotoxins  We will lose the grace of a jellyfish  the
trill of a toad  the beauty of a butterfly  the surprise
of a snake  and even the awesome scariness
of a big  hairy spider with its venomous fangs 
and that would be a big loss indeed
